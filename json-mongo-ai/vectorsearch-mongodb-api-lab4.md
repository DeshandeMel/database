# Create & Query Vector Index with Oracle Database API for MongoDB

## Introduction

In this lab, you will perform similarity search on your sample data. You will create a vector index, create a query vector, and query your vector index.

Simply put, your vector index acts as the librarian, managing and organizing the vector embeddings of each book such that look ups are quick to retreive topic specific books that will interest your readers. 

The beauty of vector indexing is the ability to manage unstructured data. Even if your library was donated audiobooks and videos, through vectorization servicing different data types provides a breadth of media options for your patrons.

Estimated Time: 40 Minutes

### Objectives

In this lab you will:

* Create a Vector Index on Oracle 23ai Database API for MongoDB

* Create a Query Vector using an ONNX model

* Query the Vector Index using MongoDB API

### Prerequisites

* Have an Oracle Autonomous Database provisioned with Lifecycle Status - Available

* Connected to your Autonomous Database through MongoDB Shell

You will need the following information, saved from previous labs:

* The ONNX model used to create your vector index

## Task 1: Create a Vector Index on Oracle 23ai Database API for MongoDB

## Task 2: Create a Query Vector using an ONNX model

## Task 3: Query the Vector Index using MongoDB API
