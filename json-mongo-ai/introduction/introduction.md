# Introduction

## **About this Workshop**

Let's take a moment to appreciate language. Language enables us to express and appreciate one another.

Have you ever wished to understand someone else’s language, to delve into their culture? With Oracle’s MongoDB API, **Oracle Can Speak Mongo**, empowering you to experience Oracle’s rich database through an entirely different language.

This lab will guide you through conducting similarity search on Oracle Database 23ai for native MongoDB Query Language (MQL) appreciators, exercising MongoDB API. You will gain familiarity with similarity search through the creation and deployment of vectors.

If you are considering migrating to Oracle's Database from Mongo, this lab will reveal how easy it is to move with **Oracle Database API for MongoDB**. 



Estimated Time: 60 Minutes


### Objectives


Through completing this lab you will have learned how to:


* Create Vector Embeddings using ONNX models


* Ingest Data into JSON Collections through MongoDB API


* Create & Query Vector Indexes on Oracle 23ai Database using MongoDB API


* Access SQL capabilities and perform tasks beyond Mongo


If you are familiar with MQL this workshop will be helpful in understanding the parallel and added capabilities provided through Oracle Database API for MongoDB.
