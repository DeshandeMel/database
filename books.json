{"title":"The Kite Runner","author":"Khaled Hosseini","published":2003,"fiction":true,"plot":"Part I\n[edit]Amir, a well-to-do Pashtun boy, and Hassan, a Hazara boy who is the son of Ali, Amir's father's servant, spend their days kite fighting in the hitherto peaceful city of Kabul. Hassan is a successful \"kite runner\" for Amir; he knows where the kite will land without watching it. Both boys are motherless: Amir's mother died in childbirth, while Hassan's mother, Sanaubar, simply abandoned him and Ali. Amir's father, a wealthy merchant Amir affectionately refers to as Baba, loves both boys. He makes a point of buying Hassan exactly the same things as Amir, to Amir's annoyance. He even pays to have Hassan's cleft lip surgically corrected. On the other hand, Baba is often critical of Amir, considering him weak and lacking in courage, even threatening to physically punish him when he complains about Hassan. Amir finds a kinder fatherly figure in Rahim Khan, Baba's closest friend, who understands him and supports his interest in writing, whereas Baba considers that interest to be worthy only of females. In a rare moment, when Amir is sitting on Baba's lap rather than being shooed away as a bother, he asks why his father drinks alcohol, which is forbidden by Islam. Baba tells him that the Mullahs are hypocrites and the only real sin is theft which takes many forms, the worst being having an affair.Assef, an older boy with a sadistic taste for violence, regularly mocks Amir for socializing with a Hazara, whose members, according to him, belong only in Hazarajat. Assef is himself only half Pashtun, having a German mother. One day, he prepares to attack Amir with brass knuckles, but Hassan defends Amir, threatening to shoot out Assef's eye with his slingshot. Assef backs off but swears to take revenge one day.One triumphant day, Amir wins the local kite-fighting tournament and finally earns Baba's praise. Hassan runs for the last cut kite, a great trophy, saying to Amir, \"For you a thousand times over!\" However, after finding the kite, Hassan encounters Assef in an alleyway. Hassan refuses to give up the kite, and Assef humiliates him by assaulting him both physically and sexually. Amir witnesses the act but is too scared to intervene. He knows that if he fails to bring home the kite, Baba would be less proud of him, so he runs away. Amir feels incredibly guilty but knows his cowardice would kill the only hope for gaining Baba's affections, so he keeps quiet about the incident. Afterwards, Amir keeps distant from Hassan; his feelings of guilt prevent him from interacting with the boy. Hassan's mental and physical well-being begin to deteriorate as a result, but he still tries to interact with Amir.Amir begins to believe that life would be easier if Hassan were not around, so he plants his watch and some birthday money under Hassan's mattress in the hope that Baba will make him leave; Hassan falsely confesses when confronted by Baba. Although Baba believes \"there is no act more wretched than stealing\", he forgives him. To Baba's sorrow, Hassan and Ali leave anyway, because Hassan has told Ali what happened to him. Amir is freed of the daily reminder of his cowardice and betrayal, but he still lives in their shadow.Part II\n[edit]In 1979, five years later, the Soviet Union militarily intervened in Afghanistan. Baba and Amir escape to Peshawar, Pakistan, and then to Fremont, California, where they settle in a run-down apartment. Baba begins work at a gas station due to his low social status in America. After graduating from high school, Amir takes classes at San Jose State University to develop his writing skills. Every Sunday, Baba and Amir make extra money selling used goods at a flea market in San Jose. There, Amir meets fellow refugee Soraya Taheri and her family. Baba is diagnosed with terminal cancer but is still capable of granting Amir one last favor: he asks Soraya's father's permission for Amir to marry her. He agrees and the two marry. Shortly after, Baba dies peacefully. Amir and Soraya settle down in a happy marriage, but to their sorrow, they learn that they cannot have children.Amir embarks on a successful career as a novelist. Fifteen years after his wedding, Amir receives a call from Rahim Khan. Rahim Khan, who is dying, asks Amir to visit him in Peshawar. He enigmatically tells Amir, \"There is a way to be good again.\"Part III\n[edit]From Rahim Khan, Amir learns that Hassan and Ali are both dead. Ali was killed by a land mine, and Hassan was murdered (along with his wife Farzana) after he refused to allow the Taliban to confiscate Baba and Amir's house in Kabul. Rahim Khan further reveals that Ali was sterile and was not Hassan's biological father. Hassan was actually the son of Sanaubar and Baba, making him Amir's half brother. Finally, Rahim Khan tells Amir that the reason he has called Amir to Pakistan is to ask him to find and rescue Hassan's son, Sohrab, from an orphanage in Kabul.Amir searches for Sohrab, accompanied by Farid, an Afghan taxi driver and veteran of the war with the Soviets. They go to a rundown orphanage where Rahim Khan said Sohrab might be but they learn from the orphanage director that a Taliban official comes to the orphanage often, brings cash, and usually takes a girl away with him. Occasionally he chooses a boy, recently Sohrab. The orphanage director tells Amir how to find the official, and Farid secures an appointment at his home by claiming to have \"personal business\" with him.The two are brought to a run-down football stadium, in which Amir watches the Leader, who he comments bears a striking resemblance to John Lennon beat two people to death with a rock for the amusement of the audience. Disgusted yet intrigued, Amir follows him inside his personal suite.Amir meets the Taliban leader, who reveals himself as Assef. Sohrab is being kept at Assef's house as a dancing boy. Assef agrees to relinquish him if Amir can escape the room alive. Assef then badly beats Amir with his brass knuckles, breaking several bones and splitting his lip, before attempting to bash his head in with a chair. However, Sohrab attacks the distracted Assef and gouges out his eye by mutilating it with a small rock. Assef screams, crashes into the furniture and collapses, allowing Amir and Sohrab to flee. Assef is last seen in agony as his guards attempt to fix what remains of his eye, and Amir never sees or hears from him again.Amir tells Sohrab of his plans to take him back to America and possibly adopt him. However, American authorities demand evidence of Sohrab's orphan status. Amir tells Sohrab that he may have to go back to an orphanage for a little while as they have encountered a problem in the adoption process, and Sohrab, terrified about returning to an orphanage, attempts suicide by cutting his wrists. Amir eventually manages to take him back to the United States with the help of Soraya. After his adoption, Sohrab refuses to interact with Amir or Soraya until Amir reminisces about Hassan and kites and shows off some of Hassan's tricks one day. After Amir helps Sohrab win his first kite fight, Sohrab only gives a lopsided smile, but Amir takes it with all his heart as he runs the kite for Sohrab, saying, \"For you, a thousand times over\" mirroring Hassan's love towards him in his youth, and completing his redemption.Protagonist\n[edit]Amir (named Amir Qadiri in 2007 film adaptation, surname is not given in book) is the protagonist and narrator of the novel. Khaled Hosseini acknowledged that the character is \"an unlikable coward who failed to come to the aid of his best friend\" for much of the duration of the story; consequently, Hosseini chose to create sympathy for Amir through circumstances rather than the personality he was given until the last third of the book.[16] Born into a Pashtun family in 1963, his mother died while giving birth to him. As a child, he enjoys storytelling and is encouraged by Rahim Khan to become a well-known writer. At age 18, he and his father flee to America following the Soviet Military invasion of Afghanistan, where he pursues his dream of being a writer.[citation needed]Main characters\n[edit]Antagonists\n[edit]Assef is the main antagonist of the novel. He is the son of a Pashtun father and a German mother, and believes that Pashtuns are superior to Hazaras, although he himself is not a full Pashtun. He is described as a \"sociopath\" by Amir.Secondary characters\n[edit]Khaled Hosseini identifies a number of themes that appear in The Kite Runner, but reviewers have focused on guilt and redemption.[9][11][19] As a child, Amir fails to save Hassan in an act of cowardice and afterwards suffers from an all-consuming guilt. Even after leaving the country, moving to America, marrying, and becoming a successful writer, he is unable to forget the incident. Hassan is \"the all-sacrificing Christ-figure, the one who, even in death, calls Amir to redemption\".[19] Following Hassan's death at the hands of the Taliban, Amir begins to redeem himself through the rescue of Hassan's son, Sohrab.[20] Hosseini draws parallels during the search for Sohrab to create an impression of poetic justice; for example, Amir sustains a split lip after being severely beaten, similar to Hassan's harelip.[20] Despite this, some critics questioned whether the protagonist had fully redeemed himself.[21]Amir's motivation for the childhood betrayal is rooted in his insecurities regarding his relationship with his father.[22] The relationship between parents and their children features prominently in the novel, and in an interview, Hosseini elaborated:When adapting The Kite Runner for the theatre, Director Eric Rose stated that he was drawn into the narrative by the \"themes of betraying your best friend for the love of your father\", which he compared to Shakespearean literature.[23] Throughout the story, Amir craves his father's affection;[22] his father, in turn, loves Amir but favors Hassan,[20] going as far as to pay for plastic surgery to repair the latter's cleft lip.[24]In the first two years following its publication, over 70,000 hardback copies of The Kite Runner were sold along with 1,250,000 paperback copies.[3] Though the book sold well in hardback, \"Kite Runner's popularity didn't really begin to soar until [2004] when the paperback edition came out, which is when book clubs began picking it up.\"[9] It started appearing on best seller lists in September 2004 and became a New York Times bestseller in March 2005,[3] maintaining its place on the list for two years.[4] By the publication of Khaled Hosseini's third novel in 2013, over seven million copies had been sold in the United States.[5] The book received the South African Boeke Prize in 2004. It was voted the Reading Group Book of the Year for 2006 and 2007 and headed a list of 60 titles submitted by entrants to the Penguin/Orange Reading Group prize (UK).[26][27]Erika Milvy from Salon praised it as \"beautifully written, startling and heart wrenching\".[28] Tony Sims from Wired Magazine wrote that the book \"reveals the beauty and agony of a tormented nation as it tells the story of an improbable friendship between two boys from opposite ends of society, and of the troubled but enduring relationship between a father and a son\".[29] Amelia Hill of The Observer opined, \"The Kite Runner is the shattering first novel by Khaled Hosseini\" that \"is simultaneously devastating and inspiring.\"[22] A similarly favourable review was printed in Publishers Weekly.[13] Marketing director Melissa Mytinger remarked, \"It's simply an excellent story. Much of it based in a world we don't know, a world we're barely beginning to know. Well-written, published at the 'right time' by an author who is both charming and thoughtful in his personal appearances for the book.\"[3] Indian-American actor Aasif Mandvi agreed that the book was \"amazing storytelling. ... It's about human beings. It's about redemption, and redemption is a powerful theme.\"[9] First Lady Laura Bush commended the story as \"really great\".[25]Said Tayeb Jawad, the 19th Afghan ambassador to the United States, publicly endorsed The Kite Runner, saying that the book would help the American public to better understand Afghan society and culture.[9]Edward Hower from The New York Times analyzed the portrayal of Afghanistan before and after the Taliban:Meghan O'Rouke, Slate Magazine's culture critic and advisory editor, ultimately found The Kite Runner mediocre, writing that \"this is a novel simultaneously striving to deliver a large-scale informative portrait and to stage a small-scale redemptive drama, but its therapeutic allegory of recovery can only undermine its realist ambitions. People experience their lives against the backdrop of their culture, and while Hosseini wisely steers clear of merely exoticizing Afghanistan as a monolithically foreign place, he does so much work to make his novel emotionally accessible to the American reader that there is almost no room, in the end, for us to consider for long what might differentiate Afghans and Americans.\"[25] Sarah Smith from The Guardian thought the novel started out well but began to falter towards the end. She felt that Hosseini was too focused on fully redeeming the protagonist in Part III and in doing so created too many unrealistic coincidences that allowed Amir the opportunity to undo his past wrongs.[20]Controversy in the United States\n[edit]The American Library Association reported that The Kite Runner was one of its most-challenged books of 2008, with multiple attempts to remove it from libraries due to its \"offensive language, sexually explicit [content], and unsuit[ability for] age group.\"[30] Afghan American readers were particularly critical towards the depiction of Pashtuns as oppressors and Hazaras as the oppressed.[11] Hosseini responded in an interview, \"They never say I am speaking about things that are untrue. Their beef is, 'Why do you have to talk about these things and embarrass us? Don't you love your country?'\"[11] Afghan-Austrian journalist Emran Feroz, however, criticized the novel for oversimplifying ethnic relations in Afghanistan and portraying Pashtuns in general in an overly negative light. Feroz further expressed concern that works by Hosseini, who was raised in a culturally Tajik context rather than Pashtun, would prevent western readers from developing a more nuanced view of Afghanistan.[31]The Kite Runner was one of the most banned books in 2021-2022.[32] As of 2024, the book has been banned from libraries at schools in Florida, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Pennsylvania, Idaho, and Wisconsin.[33]In 2024 the book was banned in Texas by the Katy Independent School District on the basis that the novel is \"adopting, supporting, or promoting gender fluidity\"[34] despite also pronouncing a bullying policy that protects infringements on the rights of the student.[35] In February 2025, the United States Department of Defense flagged the book for temporary removal Pentagon-run schools pending a review of its compliance with federal policies.[36]Film controversy in Afghanistan\n[edit]The film generated more controversy through the 30-second rape scene, with threats made against the child actors, who originated from Afghanistan.[28]Zekeria Ebrahimi, the 12-year-old actor who portrayed Amir, had to be removed from school after his Hazara classmates threatened to kill him,[37] and Paramount Pictures was eventually forced to relocate three of the children to the United Arab Emirates.[28] Afghanistan's Ministry of Culture banned the film from distribution in cinemas or DVD stores, citing the possibility that the movie's ethnically charged rape scene could incite racial violence within Afghanistan.[38]Film\n[edit]See also: The Kite Runner (film)Four years after its publication, The Kite Runner was adapted as a motion picture starring Khalid Abdalla as Amir, Homayoun Ershadi as Baba, and Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada as Hassan. It was initially scheduled to premiere in November 2007, but the release date was pushed back six weeks to evacuate the Afghan child stars from the country after they received death threats.[39] Directed by Marc Forster and with a screenplay by David Benioff, the movie won numerous awards and was nominated for an Academy Award, the BAFTA Film Award, and the Critics Choice Award in 2008.[40] While reviews were generally positive, with Entertainment Weekly deeming the final product \"pretty good\",[41] the depiction of ethnic tensions and the controversial rape scene drew outrage in Afghanistan.[39] Hangama Anwari, the child rights commissioner for the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, commented, \"They should not play around with the lives and security of people. The Hazara people will take it as an insult.\"[39]Hosseini was surprised by the extent of the controversy caused by the rape scene and said that Afghan actors would not have been cast had studios known that their lives would be threatened.[28] He believed that the scene was necessary to \"maintain the integrity\" of the story, as a physical assault by itself would not have affected the audience as much.[28]Other\n[edit]See also: Kite Runner (play)The novel was first adapted to the stage in March 2007 by Bay Area playwright Matthew Spangler where it was performed at San Jose State University.[42] Two years later, David Ira Goldstein, artistic director of Arizona Theater Company, organized for it to be performed at San Jose Repertory Theatre. The play was produced at Arizona Theatre Company in 2009, Actor's Theatre of Louisville and Cleveland Play House in 2010, and The New Repertory Theatre of Watertown, Massachusetts in 2012. The theatre adaption premiered in Canada as a co-production between Theatre Calgary and the Citadel Theatre in January 2013. In April 2013, the play premiered in Europe at the Nottingham Playhouse, with Ben Turner acting in the lead role.[43]Hosseini was approached by Piemme, his Italian publisher, about adapting The Kite Runner to a graphic novel in 2011. Having been \"a fan of comic books since childhood\", he was open to the idea, believing that The Kite Runner was a good candidate to be presented in a visual format.[29] Fabio Celoni provided the illustrations for the project and regularly updated Hosseini on his progress before its release in September of that year.[29] The latter was pleased with the final product and said, \"I believe Fabio Celoni's work vividly brings to life not only the mountains, the bazaars, the city of Kabul and its kite-dotted skies, but also the many struggles, conflicts, and emotional highs and lows of Amir's journey.\"[29]Portals:\nUnited States\nAfghanistan\nNovels^ Noor, R.; Hosseini, Khaled (September–December 2004). \"The Kite Runner\".

{"title":"The Great Gatsby","author":"F. Scott Fitzgerald","published":1925,"fiction":true,"plot":"George Wilson and his wife Myrtle live in the \"valley of ashes\", arefuse dump(shown in the above photograph) historically located in New York City during the 1920s. Today, the area isFlushing Meadows–Corona Park.In spring 1922, Nick Carraway—a Yale alumnus from the Midwest and a World War I veteran—journeys to New York City to obtain employment as a bond salesman. He rents a bungalow in the Long Island village of West Egg, next to a luxurious estate inhabited by Jay Gatsby, an enigmatic multi-millionaire who hosts dazzling soirées yet does not partake in them.One evening, Nick dines with a distant cousin, Daisy Buchanan, in the old money town of East Egg. Daisy is married to Tom Buchanan, formerly a Yale football star whom Nick knew during his college days. The couple has recently relocated from Chicago to a mansion directly across the bay from Gatsby's estate. There, Nick encounters Jordan Baker, an insolent flapper and golf champion who is a childhood friend of Daisy's. Jordan confides to Nick that Tom keeps a mistress, who brazenly telephones him at his home and lives in the \"valley of ashes\", a sprawling refuse dump.[33] That evening, Nick sees Gatsby standing alone on his lawn, staring at a green light across the bay.Days later, Nick reluctantly accompanies a drunken and agitated Tom to New York City by train. En route, they stop at a garage inhabited by mechanic George Wilson and his wife—and Tom's mistress—Myrtle. Myrtle joins them, and the trio proceeds to a small New York apartment that Tom has rented for trysts with her. Guests arrive and a party ensues, which ends with Tom slapping Myrtle and breaking her nose after she mentions Daisy.One morning, Nick receives a formal invitation to a party at Gatsby's mansion. Once there, Nick is embarrassed that he recognizes no one and begins drinking heavily until he encounters Jordan. While chatting with her, he is approached by a man who introduces himself as Jay Gatsby and insists that both he and Nick served in the 3rd Infantry Division[c] during the war. Gatsby attempts to ingratiate himself with Nick and when Nick leaves the party, he notices Gatsby watching him.In late July, Nick and Gatsby have lunch at a speakeasy. Gatsby tries impressing Nick with tales of his war heroism and his Oxford days. Afterward, Nick meets Jordan again at the Plaza Hotel. Jordan reveals that Gatsby and Daisy met around 1917 when Gatsby was an officer in the American Expeditionary Forces. They fell in love, but when Gatsby was deployed overseas, Daisy reluctantly married Tom. Gatsby hopes that his newfound wealth and dazzling parties will make Daisy reconsider. Gatsby uses Nick to stage a reunion with Daisy, and the two embark upon an affair.In September, Tom discovers the affair when Daisy carelessly addresses Gatsby with unabashed intimacy in front of him. Later, at a Plaza Hotel suite, Gatsby and Tom argue about the affair. Gatsby insists Daisy declare that she never loved Tom. Daisy claims she loves Tom and Gatsby, upsetting both. Tom reveals Gatsby is a swindler whose money comes from bootlegging alcohol. Upon hearing this, Daisy chooses to stay with Tom. Tom scornfully tells Gatsby to drive her home, knowing that Daisy will never leave him.While returning to East Egg, Gatsby and Daisy drive by Wilson's garage and their car strikes Myrtle, killing her instantly. Later Gatsby reveals to Nick that Daisy was driving the car, but that he intends to take the blame for the accident to protect her. Nick urges Gatsby to flee to avoid prosecution, but he refuses. After Tom tells George that Gatsby owns the car that struck Myrtle, a distraught George assumes the owner of the vehicle must be Myrtle's lover. George fatally shoots Gatsby in his mansion's swimming pool, then kills himself.Several days after Gatsby's murder, his father Henry Gatz arrives for the sparsely attended funeral. After Gatsby's death, Nick comes to hate New York and decides that Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, and he were all Midwesterners unsuited to Eastern life.[d] Nick encounters Tom and initially refuses to shake his hand. Tom admits he was the one who told George that Gatsby owned the vehicle that killed Myrtle. Before returning to the Midwest, Nick returns to Gatsby's mansion and stares across the bay at the green light emanating from the end of Daisy's dock.Edith Cummings, a premieramateur golfer, inspired the character of Jordan Baker. A friend of Ginevra King, she was one ofChicago's famous debutantesin the Jazz Age.The now-demolished Beacon Towers partly served as an inspiration for Gatsby's home.\nOheka Castle was another North Shore inspiration for the novel's setting.Fitzgerald began outlining his third novel in June 1922.[7] He longed to produce an exquisite work that was beautiful and intricately patterned,[59] but the troubled production of his stage play The Vegetable repeatedly interrupted his progress.[60] The play flopped, and Fitzgerald wrote magazine stories that winter to pay debts incurred by its production.[61] He viewed these stories as all worthless,[60] although included among them was \"Winter Dreams\", which Fitzgerald described as his first attempt at the Gatsby idea.[62] \"The whole idea of Gatsby\", he later explained to a friend, \"is the unfairness of a poor young man not being able to marry a girl with money. This theme comes up again and again because I lived it\".[63]In October 1922, after the birth of their only child, Frances Scott \"Scottie\" Fitzgerald, the Fitzgeralds moved to Great Neck, New York, on Long Island.[64] Their neighbors in Great Neck included such newly wealthy personages as writer Ring Lardner, actor Lew Fields and comedian Ed Wynn.[7] These figures were all considered to be nouveau riche, unlike those who came from Manhasset Neck, which sat across the bay from Great Neck—places that were home to many of New York's wealthiest established families.[65] This real-life juxtaposition gave Fitzgerald his idea for \"West Egg\" and \"East Egg\". In the novel, Great Neck (Kings Point) became the \"new money\" peninsula of West Egg and Port Washington (Sands Point) became the \"old money\" East Egg.[65] Several Gold Coast mansions in the area served as inspiration for Gatsby's estate including Land's End,[66]Oheka Castle,[67] and the since-demolished Beacon Towers.[68]While living on Long Island, the Fitzgeralds' enigmatic neighbor was Max Gerlach.[f][37][72] Purportedly born in America to a German immigrant family,[g] Gerlach had been a major in the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I, and he later became a gentleman bootlegger who lived like a millionaire in New York.[74] Flaunting his new wealth,[h] Gerlach threw lavish parties,[76] never wore the same shirt twice,[77] used the phrase \"old sport\",[78] and fostered myths about himself including that he was a relation of the German Kaiser.[79] These details about Gerlach inspired Fitzgerald in his creation of Jay Gatsby.[80]During this same time period, the daily newspapers sensationalized the Hall–Mills murder case over many months, and the highly publicized case likely influenced the plot of Fitzgerald's novel.[81] The case involved the double-murder of a man and his lover on September 14, 1922, mere weeks before Fitzgerald arrived in Great Neck. Scholars have speculated that Fitzgerald based certain aspects of the ending of The Great Gatsby and various characterizations on this factual incident.[82]Inspired by the Halls–Mills case, the mysterious persona of Gerlach and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island, Fitzgerald had written 18,000 words for his novel by mid-1923 but discarded most of his new story as a false start.[83] Some of this early draft resurfaced in the 1924 short story \"Absolution\".[84] In earlier drafts,[i] Daisy was originally named Ada and Nick was Dud,[86] and the two characters had shared a previous romance prior to their reunion on Long Island.[87] These earlier drafts were written from the viewpoint of an omniscient narrator as opposed to Nick's perspective.[88] A key difference in earlier drafts is a less complete failure of Gatsby's dream.[89] Another difference is that the argument between Tom Buchanan and Gatsby is more balanced, although Daisy still returns to Tom.[89]Work on The Great Gatsby resumed in earnest in April 1924.[90] Fitzgerald decided to depart from the writing process of his previous novels and told Perkins that he was intent on creating an artistic achievement.[91] He wished to eschew the realism of his previous two novels and to compose a creative work of sustained imagination.[92] To this end, he consciously imitated the literary styles of Joseph Conrad and Willa Cather.[93] He was particularly influenced by Cather's 1923 work, A Lost Lady,[94] which features a wealthy married socialite pursued by a variety of romantic suitors and who symbolically embodies the American dream.[95][96] He later wrote a letter to Cather apologizing for any unintentional plagiarism.[94] During this period of revisions, Scott saw and was influenced by early sketches for the book's dust jacket art.[97][98] Soon after this burst of effort, work slowed while the Fitzgeralds moved to the Villa Marie in Saint-Raphaël on the French Riviera, where a marital crisis soon developed.[j]Despite his ongoing marital tension, Fitzgerald continued to write steadily and submitted a near-final version of the manuscript to his editor, Maxwell Perkins, on October 27.[100] Perkins informed him in a November letter that Gatsby was too vague as a character and that his wealth and business, respectively, needed a convincing explanation.[101] Fitzgerald thanked Perkins for his detailed criticisms and claimed that such feedback would enable him to perfect the manuscript.[102] Having relocated with his wife to Rome,[103] Fitzgerald made revisions to the manuscript throughout the winter.[101]Content after a few rounds of revision, Fitzgerald submitted the final version in February 1925.[104] Fitzgerald's alterations included extensive revisions of the sixth and eighth chapters.[105] He declined an offer of $10,000 for the serial rights to the book so that it could be published sooner.[106] He received a $3,939 advance in 1923 and would receive $1,981.25 upon publication.[107]Alternative titles\n[edit]Fitzgerald had difficulty choosing a title for his novel and entertained many choices before reluctantly deciding on The Great Gatsby,[108] a title inspired by Alain-Fournier's Le Grand Meaulnes.[109] Previously he had shifted between Among Ash Heaps and Millionaires,[108]Trimalchio,[108]Trimalchio in West Egg,[110]On the Road to West Egg,[110]Under the Red, White, and Blue,[108]The Gold-Hatted Gatsby,[110] and The High-Bouncing Lover.[110] The titles The Gold-Hatted Gatsby and The High-Bouncing Lover came from Fitzgerald's epigraph for the novel, one which he wrote himself under the pen name of Thomas Parke D'Invilliers.[111]Fitzgerald initially preferred titles referencing Trimalchio,[k] the crude upstart in Petronius's Satyricon, and even refers to Gatsby as Trimalchio once in the novel.[113] Unlike Gatsby's spectacular parties, Trimalchio participated in the orgies he hosted but, according to literary critic Tony Tanner, there are subtle similarities between the two characters.[114] By November 1924, Fitzgerald wrote to Perkins that he had settled upon the title of Trimalchio in West Egg.[115]Disliking Fitzgerald's chosen title of Trimalchio in West Egg, editor Max Perkins persuaded him that the reference was too obscure and that people would be unable to pronounce it.[116] Zelda and Perkins both expressed their preference for The Great Gatsby, and the next month Fitzgerald agreed.[117] A month before publication, after a final review of the proofs, he asked if it would be possible to re-title it Trimalchio or Gold-Hatted Gatsby, but Perkins advised against it. On March 19, 1925,[118] Fitzgerald expressed enthusiasm for the title Under the Red, White, and Blue, but it was too late to change it at that stage.[119][120] The novel was published as The Great Gatsby on April 10, 1925.[121] Fitzgerald believed the book's final title to be merely acceptable and often expressed his ambivalence with the name.[122]Dust jacket art\n[edit]Further information: Celestial EyesDrafts of the dust jacket by artist Francis Cugat juxtaposed with the final version. In one draft (first), a single eye loomed over Long Island Sound. In a subsequent draft (second), Cugat expanded upon this concept to feature two eyes gazing over the New York cityscape. In the final draft (third), the shadowy cityscape was replaced by carnival lights evoking Coney Island.The artwork for the first edition of The Great Gatsby, known as Celestial Eyes, is among the most celebrated in American literature and represents a unique instance in literary history in which a novel's commissioned artwork directly influenced the composition of the text.[123] Rendered in an Art Deco visual style,[124] the artwork depicts the disembodied face of a Jazz Age flapper with celestial eyes and rouged mouth over a dark blue skyline.[125] A little-known Barcelonan painter named Francis Cugat—born Francisco Coradal-Cougat—was commissioned by an unknown individual in Scribner's art department to illustrate the cover while Fitzgerald was composing the novel.[126]In a preliminary sketch, Cugat drew a concept of a dismal gray landscape inspired by Fitzgerald's original title for the novel, Among Ash Heaps and Millionaires.[127] Discarding this gloomy concept, Cugat next drew a divergent study which became the prefiguration to the final cover: A pencil and crayon drawing of a flapper's half-hidden visage over Long Island Sound with scarlet lips, one celestial eye, and a single diagonal tear.[128] Expanding upon this study, his subsequent drawing featured two bright eyes looming over a shadowy New York cityscape.[129] In later iterations, Cugat replaced the shadowy cityscape with dazzling carnival lights evoking a Ferris wheel and likely referencing the glittering amusement park at New York's Coney Island.[130] Cugat affixed reclining nudes within the flapper's irises and added a green tint to the streaming tear.[131] Cugat's final cover,[l] which Max Perkins hailed as a masterpiece, was the only work he completed for Scribner's and the only book cover he ever designed.[133]Although Fitzgerald likely never saw the final gouache painting prior to the novel's publication,[134] Cugat's preparatory drafts influenced his writing.[97][124] Upon viewing Cugat's drafts before sailing for France in April–May 1924,[97][98] Fitzgerald was so enamored that he later told editor Max Perkins that he had incorporated Cugat's imagery into the novel.[135] This statement has led many to analyze interrelations between Cugat's art and Fitzgerald's text.[135] One popular interpretation is that the celestial eyes are reminiscent of those of optometrist T. J. Eckleburg depicted on a faded commercial billboard near George Wilson's auto repair shop.[136] Author Ernest Hemingway supported this latter interpretation and claimed that Fitzgerald had told him the cover referred to a billboard in the valley of the ashes.[137] Although this passage has some resemblance to the imagery, a closer explanation can be found in Fitzgerald's explicit description of Daisy Buchanan as the \"girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs\".[126]Initial reviews\n[edit]Charles Scribner's Sons published The Great Gatsby on April 10, 1925.[138] Fitzgerald cabled Perkins the day after publication to monitor reviews: \"Any news?\"[138] \"Sales situation doubtful [but] excellent reviews\", read a telegram from Perkins on April 20.[139] Fitzgerald responded on April 24, saying the cable dispirited him, closing the letter with \"Yours in great depression\".[139] Fitzgerald soon received letters from contemporaries Willa Cather, Edith Wharton, and poet T. S. Eliot praising the novel.[140] Although gratified by such correspondence, Fitzgerald sought public acclaim from professional critics.[141]The Great Gatsby received generally favorable reviews from literary critics of the day.[142] Edwin Clark of The New York Times felt the novel was a mystical and glamorous tale of the Jazz Age.[143] Similarly, Lillian C. Ford of the Los Angeles Times hailed the novel as a revelatory work of art that \"leaves the reader in a mood of chastened wonder\".[144] The New York Post described Fitzgerald's prose style as scintillating and genuinely brilliant.[145] The New York Herald Tribune was less impressed, referring to The Great Gatsby as \"a literary lemon meringue\" that nonetheless \"contains some of the nicest little touches of contemporary observation you could imagine—so light, so delicate, so sharp\".[146] In The Chicago Daily Tribune, H. L. Mencken judged the work's plot to be highly improbable, although he praised the writing as elegant and the \"careful and brilliant finish\".[147]Several reviewers felt the novel left much to be desired following Fitzgerald's previous works and criticized him accordingly. Harvey Eagleton of The Dallas Morning News predicted that the novel signaled the end of Fitzgerald's artistic success.[148] Ralph Coghlan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch dismissed the work as an inconsequential performance by a once-promising author who had grown bored and cynical.[149] Ruth Snyder of New York Evening World lambasted the book's style as painfully forced and declared the editors of her newspaper were \"quite convinced after reading The Great Gatsby that Mr. Fitzgerald is not one of the great American writers of today\".[150] John McClure of The Times-Picayune insisted the plot was implausible and the book itself seemed raw in its construction.[151]After reading these reviews, Fitzgerald believed that many critics misunderstood the novel.[91] He despaired that \"of all the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about\".[152] In particular, Fitzgerald resented criticisms of the novel's plot as implausible since he had never intended for the story to be realistic.[91] Instead, he crafted the work to be a romanticized depiction that was largely scenic and symbolic.[153] According to his friend John Peale Bishop, Fitzgerald further resented the fact that critics failed to perceive the many parallels between the author's life and the character of Jay Gatsby; in particular, that both created a mythical version of themselves and attempted to live up to this legend.[154] Dispirited by critics failing to understand the novel, Fitzgerald remained hopeful that the novel would at least be a commercial success, perhaps selling as many as 75,000 copies.[155]To Fitzgerald's great disappointment, Gatsby was a commercial failure in comparison with his previous efforts, This Side of Paradise (1920) and The Beautiful and Damned (1922). By October, the book had sold fewer than 20,000 copies.[60] Although the novel went through two initial printings, many copies remained unsold years later.[156] Fitzgerald attributed the poor sales to the fact that women tended to be the primary audience for novels during this time, and Gatsby did not contain an admirable female character.[156] According to his ledger, he earned only $2,000 from the book.[157] Although Owen Davis' 1926 stage adaptation and the Paramount-issued silent film version brought in money for the author, Fitzgerald lamented that the novel fell far short of the success he had hoped for and would not bring him recognition as a serious novelist in the public eye.[60] With the onset of the Great Depression, The Great Gatsby was regarded as little more than a nostalgic period piece.[60] By the time Fitzgerald died in 1940, the novel had fallen into near obscurity.[158]Revival and reassessment\n[edit]In 1940, Fitzgerald suffered a third and fatal heart attack and died believing his work forgotten.[159] His obituary in The New York Times hailed him as a brilliant novelist and cited Gatsby as his greatest work.[160] In the wake of Fitzgerald's death, a strong appreciation for the book gradually developed in writers' circles. Future authors Budd Schulberg and Edward Newhouse were deeply affected by it, and John O'Hara acknowledged its influence on his work.[161] By the time that Gatsby was republished in Edmund Wilson's edition of The Last Tycoon in 1941, the prevailing opinion in writers' circles deemed the novel to be an enduring work of fiction.[60]In the spring of 1942, mere months after the United States' entrance into World War II, an association of publishing executives created the Council on Books in Wartime with the stated purpose of distributing paperback Armed Services Editions books to combat troops. The Great Gatsby was one of them.[162] Within the next several years, 155,000 copies of Gatsby were distributed to U.S. soldiers overseas,[163] and the book proved popular among beleaguered troops, according to the Saturday Evening Post's 1945 report.[164]By 1944, a full-scale Fitzgerald revival had occurred.[165] Full-length scholarly articles on Fitzgerald's works were being published in periodicals and, by the following year, the earlier consensus among professional critics that The Great Gatsby was merely a sensational story or a nostalgic period piece had effectively vanished.[166] The tireless promotional efforts of literary critic Edmund Wilson, who was Fitzgerald's Princeton classmate and his close friend, led this Fitzgerald revival.[167] In 1951, three years after Zelda's death in a hospital fire, Professor Arthur Mizener of Cornell University published The Far Side of Paradise, the first biography of Fitzgerald.[168] Mizener's bestselling biography emphasized The Great Gatsby's positive reception by literary critics, which may have further influenced public opinion and renewed interest in it.[169]By 1960—thirty-five years after the novel's original publication—the book was steadily selling 100,000 copies per year.[170] Renewed interest in it led The New York Times editorialist Mizener to proclaim the novel was a masterwork of 20th-century American literature.[60] By 1974, The Great Gatsby had attained its status as a literary masterwork and was deemed a contender for the title of the \"Great American Novel\".[171]By the mid-2000s, many literary critics considered The Great Gatsby to be one of the greatest novels ever written,[172] and the work was part of the assigned curricula in the near majority of U.S. high schools.[158] As of early 2020, The Great Gatsby had sold almost 30 million copies worldwide and continues to sell an additional 500,000 copies annually.[173] Numerous foreign editions of the novel have been published,[174] and the text has been translated into 42 different languages.[175] The work is Scribner's most popular title; in 2013, the e-book alone sold 185,000 copies.[175] The American Library Association lists the book as among the most challenged classics in U.S. literature.[176] The novel's U.S. copyright expired on January 1, 2021, when all works published in 1925 entered the public domain.[177] Since then, numerous altered and incomplete reprints have flooded the market.[178]Major themes\n[edit]The American Dream\n[edit]Following the novel's revival, later critical writings on The Great Gatsby focused on Fitzgerald's disillusionment with the American Dream in the hedonistic Jazz Age,[179] a name for the era which Fitzgerald claimed to have coined.[180] In 1970, scholar Roger L. Pearson asserted that Fitzgerald's work—more so than other twentieth century novels—is especially linked with this conceptualization of the American dream.[181] Pearson traced the literary origins of this dream to Colonial America. The dream is the belief that every individual, regardless of their origins, may seek and achieve their desired goals, \"be they political, monetary, or social. It is the literary expression of the concept of America: The land of opportunity\".[181]However, Pearson noted that Fitzgerald's particular treatment of this theme is devoid of the discernible optimism in the writings of earlier American authors.[181] He suggests Gatsby serves as a false prophet of the American dream, and pursuing the dream only results in dissatisfaction for those who chase it, owing to its unattainability.[182] In this analytical context, the green light on the Buchanans' dock (visible across Long Island Sound from Gatsby's house) is frequently interpreted as a symbol of Gatsby's unrealizable goal to win Daisy and, consequently, to achieve the American Dream.[158][183] Also, scholar Sarah Churchwell points out that adultery in the novel is linked to the loss of faith and broken promises, which symbolizes the corruption of the American Dream.[184]Class permanence\n[edit]Scholars and writers commonly ascribe Gatsby's inability to achieve the American Dream to entrenched class disparities in American society.[185] The novel underscores the limits of the American lower class to transcend their station of birth.[119] Scholar Sarah Churchwell contends that Fitzgerald's novel is a tale of class warfare in a status-obsessed country that refuses to acknowledge publicly it even has a class system.[119]Although scholars posit different explanations for the continuation of class differences in the United States, there is a consensus regarding the novel's message in conveying its underlying permanence.[186] Although Gatsby's fundamental conflict occurs between entrenched sources of socio-economic power and upstarts like Gatsby who threaten their interests,[187] Fitzgerald's novel shows that a class permanence persists despite the country's capitalist economy that prizes innovation and adaptability.[187] Dianne Bechtel argues Fitzgerald plotted the novel to illustrate that class transcends wealth in America. Even if the poorer Americans become rich, they remain inferior to those Americans with \"old money\".[188] Consequently, Gatsby and other characters in the novel are trapped in a rigid American class system.[189]Gender relations\n[edit]Besides exploring the difficulties of achieving the American dream, The Great Gatsby explores societal gender expectations during the Jazz Age.[190] The character of Daisy Buchanan has been identified specifically as personifying the emerging cultural archetype of the flapper.[39] Flappers were typically young, modern women who bobbed their hair and wore short skirts.[191][192] They also drank alcohol and had premarital sex.[193][6]Despite the newfound societal freedoms attained by flappers in the 1920s,[194] Fitzgerald's work critically examines the continued limitations upon women's agency during this period.[195] In this context, although early critics viewed the character of Daisy to be a \"monster of bitchery\",[196] later scholars such as Leland S. Person Jr. asserted that Daisy's character exemplifies the marginalization of women in the elite social environment that Fitzgerald depicts.[197]Writing in 1978, Person noted Daisy is more of a hapless victim than a manipulative victimizer.[198] She is the target first of Tom's callous domination and next of Gatsby's dehumanizing adoration.[198] She involuntarily becomes the holy grail at the center of Gatsby's unrealistic quest to be steadfast to a youthful concept of himself.[198] The ensuing contest of wills between Tom and Gatsby reduces Daisy to a trophy wife whose sole existence is to augment her possessor's socio-economic success.[199]As an upper-class white woman living in East Egg during this time period, Daisy must adhere to societal expectations and gender norms such as actively fulfilling the roles of dutiful wife, nurturing mother, and charming socialite.[195] Many of Daisy's choices—ultimately culminating in the fatal car crash and misery for all those involved—can be partly attributed to her prescribed role as a \"beautiful little fool\" who is reliant on her husband for financial and societal security.[m][201] Her decision to remain with her husband, despite her feelings for Gatsby, is because of the security that her marriage to Tom Buchanan provides.[196]Race and displacement\n[edit]Many scholars have analyzed the novel's treatment of race and displacement; in particular, a perceived threat posed by newer immigrants to older Americans, triggering concerns over a loss of socio-economic status.[202] In one instance, Tom Buchanan—the novel's antagonist—claims that he, Nick, and Jordan are racially superior Nordics. Tom decries immigration and advocates white supremacy.[203] A fictional book alluded to by Tom is Goddard's The Rise of the Colored Empires, which is a parody by Fitzgerald of Lothrop Stoddard's The Rising Tide of Color, a 1920s bestseller.[204] Stoddard warned that immigration would alter America's racial composition and destroy the country.[205]Analyzing these elements, literary theorist Walter Benn Michaels contends that Fitzgerald's novel reflects a historical period in American literature characterized by fears over the influx of Southern and Eastern European immigrants whose \"otherness\" challenged Americans' sense of national identity.[206] Such anxieties were more salient in national discourse than the societal consequences of World War I,[207][208] and the defining question of the period was who constituted \"a real American\".[209]In this context of immigration and displacement, Tom's hostility towards Gatsby, who is the embodiment of \"latest America\",[210] has been interpreted as partly embodying status anxieties of the time involving anti-immigrant sentiment.[210] Gatsby—whom Tom belittles as \"Mr. Nobody from Nowhere\"[211]—functions as a cipher because of his obscure origins, his unclear ethno-religious identity and his indeterminate class status.[212] Although his ethnicity is vague, his last name Gatz and his father's adherence to the Lutheran religion indicate his family are recent German immigrants.[213] This would preclude them from the coveted status of Old Stock Americans.[213] Consequently, Gatsby's socio-economic ascent is deemed a threat not only due to his status as nouveau riche, but because he is perceived as an outsider.[214]Because of such themes, The Great Gatsby captures the perennial American experience as it is a story about change and those who resist it—whether such change comes in the form of a new wave of immigrants, the nouveau riche, or successful minorities.[187] Since Americans living in the 1920s to the present are largely defined by their fluctuating socio-economic circumstances and must navigate a society with entrenched racial and ethnic prejudices, Fitzgerald's depiction of resultant status anxieties and social conflict has been highlighted by scholars as still enduringly relevant nearly a hundred years after the novel's publication.[187][215]Sexuality and identity\n[edit]Questions regarding the sexuality of characters have been raised for decades and—augmented by biographical details about the author—have given rise to queer readings.[216] During his lifetime, Fitzgerald's sexuality became a subject of debate among his friends and acquaintances.[217][218][219] As a youth, Fitzgerald had a close relationship with Father Sigourney Fay,[220] a possibly gay Catholic priest,[221][222] and Fitzgerald later used his last name for the idealized romantic character of Daisy Fay.[223] After college, Fitzgerald cross-dressed during outings in Minnesota.[224] Years later, while drafting The Great Gatsby, rumors dogged Fitzgerald among the American expat community in Paris that he was gay.[218] Soon after, Fitzgerald's wife Zelda Fitzgerald likewise doubted his heterosexuality and asserted that he was a closeted homosexual.[225] She publicly belittled him with homophobic slurs,[226] and she alleged that Fitzgerald and fellow writer Ernest Hemingway engaged in homosexual relations.[227][228] These incidents strained the Fitzgeralds' marriage at the time of the novel's publication.[225]Although Fitzgerald's sexuality is a subject of scholarly debate,[n] such biographical details lent credence to critical interpretations that his fictional characters are either gay or bisexual surrogates.[o][233][231] As early as 1945, critics such as Lionel Trilling noted that characters in The Great Gatsby, such as Jordan Baker, were implied to be \"vaguely homosexual\",[234][235] and, in 1960, writer Otto Friedrich commented upon the ease of examining the thwarted relations depicted in Fitzgerald's fiction through a queer lens.[236] In recent decades, scholarship has focused sharply on the sexuality of Nick Carraway.[237] In one instance in the novel, Carraway departs a drunken orgy with a \"pale, feminine\" man named Mr. McKee and—following suggestive ellipses—Nick next finds himself standing beside a bed while McKee sits between the sheets clad only in his underwear.[238][239] Such scenes have led scholars to describe Nick as possessing an overt queerness and prompted analyses about his emotional attachment to Jay Gatsby.[240] For these reasons, the novel has been described as an exploration of sexual identity during a historical era typified by the societal transition towards modernity.[241][242]Technology and environment\n[edit]Technological and environmental criticisms of Gatsby seek to place the novel and its characters in a broader historical context.[243] In 1964, Leo Marx argued in The Machine in the Garden that Fitzgerald's work evinces a tension between a complex pastoral ideal of a bygone America and the societal transformations caused by industrialization and machine technology.[244] Specifically, the valley of the ashes, in between East and West Egg, represents a man-made wasteland which is a byproduct of the industrialization that has made Gatsby's booming lifestyle, including his automobile, possible.[245] Marx argues that Fitzgerald, via Nick, expresses a pastoral longing typical of other 1920s American writers like William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway.[246] Although such writers cherish the pastoral ideal, they accept that technological progress has deprived this ideal of nearly all meaning.[247] In this context, Nick's repudiation of the eastern United States represents a futile attempt to withdraw into nature.[247] Yet, as Fitzgerald's work shows, any technological demarcation between the eastern and western United States has vanished,[d] and one cannot escape into a pastoral past.[247]In 2018, scholar Kyle Keeler argued that the voracious pursuit of wealth as criticized in Fitzgerald's novel offers a warning about the perils of environmental destruction in pursuit of self-interest.[250] According to Kyle Keeler, Gatsby's quest for greater status manifests as self-centered, anthropocentric resource acquisition.[250] Inspired by the predatory mining practices of his fictional mentor Dan Cody, Gatsby participates in extensive deforestation amid World War I and then undertakes bootlegging activities reliant upon exploiting South American agriculture.[250] Gatsby conveniently ignores the wasteful devastation of the valley of ashes to pursue a consumerist lifestyle and exacerbates the wealth gap that became increasingly salient in 1920s America.[250] For these reasons, Keeler argues that—while Gatsby's socioeconomic ascent and self-transformation depend upon these very factors—each one is nonetheless partially responsible for the ongoing ecological crisis.[250]Antisemitism\n[edit]Fitzgerald based the character of Meyer Wolfsheim onJazz AgeracketeerArnold Rothstein(pictured above) who was murdered in 1928.The Great Gatsby has been accused of antisemitism because of its use of Jewish stereotypes.[251] One of the novel's supporting characters is Meyer Wolfsheim,[p] a Jewish friend and mentor of Gatsby. A corrupt profiteer who assists Gatsby's bootlegging operations and who fixed the 1919 World Series, he appears only twice in the novel, the second time refusing to attend Gatsby's funeral. Fitzgerald describes Wolfsheim as \"a small, flat-nosed Jew\", with \"tiny eyes\" and \"two fine growths of hair\" in his nostrils.[254] Evoking ethnic stereotypes regarding the Jewish nose, he describes Wolfsheim's nose as \"expressive\", \"tragic\", and able to \"flash ... indignantly\".[254] The fictional character of Wolfsheim is an allusion to real-life Jewish gambler Arnold Rothstein,[255] a notorious New York crime kingpin whom Fitzgerald met once in undetermined circumstances.[256] Rothstein was blamed for match fixing in the Black Sox Scandal that tainted the 1919 World Series.[257]Wolfsheim has been interpreted as representing the Jewish miser stereotype. Richard Levy, author of Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, claims that Wolfsheim serves to link Jewishness with corruption.[254] In a 1947 article for Commentary, Milton Hindus, an assistant professor of humanities at the University of Chicago, stated that while he believed the book was a superb literary achievement, Wolfsheim was its most abrasive character, and the work contains an antisemitic undertone.[258] However, Hindus argued the Jewish stereotypes displayed by Wolfsheim were typical of the time when the novel was written and set and that its antisemitism was of the \"habitual, customary, 'harmless,' unpolitical variety\".[259] A 2015 article by essayist Arthur Krystal agreed with Hindus' assessment that Fitzgerald's use of Jewish caricatures was not driven by malice and merely reflected commonly held beliefs of his time. He notes the accounts of Frances Kroll, a Jewish woman and secretary to Fitzgerald, who claimed that Fitzgerald was hurt by accusations of antisemitism and responded to critiques of Wolfsheim by claiming he merely \"fulfilled a function in the story and had nothing to do with race or religion\".[251]Further information: Adaptations of The Great GatsbyPlays\n[edit]The first stage adaptation was produced by William Brady, a veteran theatrical impresario and promoter of prize fights, who acquired the rights only a few days after first reading the novel in the spring of 1925. The script was written by the American dramatist Owen Davis, who had won a Pulitzer Prize in 1923 for his play, Icebound.[260] Davis dramatically altered the structure of the novel, rearranging the action in chronological order, eliminating prominent elements such as the valley of ashes and the scene in the Plaza Hotel, and inventing minor characters.[261]The play, directed by George Cukor and starring James Rennie as Gatsby and Florence Eldridge as Daisy, opened on Broadway on February 2, 1926. It was well received by critics and the public, and the run was extended past the originally scheduled closing date, finally ending on May 22, after 112 performances.[262] The production, with some changes in the cast, then moved to Chicago, where it opened on August 1. Its popularity again led to an extension of the run, which came to an end in late September.[263] A brief one-week return engagement at New York's Shubert Theater began on October 4, after which a road production traveled to several other cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, Detroit, St. Louis, Denver, and Minneapolis.[264]In July 2006, a stage adaptation written by Simon Levy and directed by David Esbjornson premiered at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis to celebrate the opening of its new building.[265] In 2010, critic Ben Brantley of The New York Times highly praised the debut of Gatz, an Off-Broadway staging of the novel's full text by Elevator Repair Service.[266] The New York Metropolitan Opera commissioned John Harbison to compose an operatic treatment of the novel to commemorate the 25th anniversary of James Levine's debut. The work, called The Great Gatsby, premiered on December 20, 1999.[267]The novel has also been adapted for ballet performances. In 2009, BalletMet premiered a version at the Capitol Theatre in Columbus, Ohio.[268] In 2010, The Washington Ballet premiered a version at the Kennedy Center. The show received an encore run the following year.[269]Film\n[edit]A lobby card for the lost 1926 film adaptation\nThe 1926 film trailer—the only extant footageThe first film version of the novel appeared in 1926. A version of Owen Davis's Broadway play of the same year, it was directed by Herbert Brenon and starred Warner Baxter, Lois Wilson and William Powell. It is a famous example of a lost film. Reviews suggest it may have been the most faithful adaptation of the novel, but a trailer of the film at the National Archives is all that is known to exist.[270] Reportedly, Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda loathed the silent version. Zelda wrote to an acquaintance that the film was \"rotten\". She and Scott left the cinema midway through the film.[271]Following the 1926 film was 1949's The Great Gatsby, directed by Elliott Nugent and starring Alan Ladd, Betty Field and Macdonald Carey.[272] Twenty-five years later in 1974, The Great Gatsby appeared onscreen again. It was directed by Jack Clayton and starred Robert Redford as Gatsby, Mia Farrow as Daisy, and Sam Waterston as Nick Carraway.[272] Most recently, The Great Gatsby was directed by Baz Luhrmann in 2013 and starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby, Carey Mulligan as Daisy, and Tobey Maguire as Nick.[271]In 2021, visual effects company DNEG Animation announced they would be producing an animated film adaptation of the novel directed by William Joyce and written by Brian Selznick.[273]Television\n[edit]Gatsby has been retold as a short-form television movie multiple times. The first was in 1955 as an NBC episode for Robert Montgomery Presents starring Robert Montgomery, Phyllis Kirk, and Lee Bowman. The episode was directed by Alvin Sapinsley.[274] In 1958, CBS filmed another adaptation as an episode of Playhouse 90, also titled The Great Gatsby, which was directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and starred Robert Ryan, Jeanne Crain and Rod Taylor.[275] Most recently, the novel was adapted as an A&E movie in 2000. The Great Gatsby was directed by Robert Markowitz and starred Toby Stephens as Gatsby, Mira Sorvino as Daisy, and Paul Rudd as Nick.[276][275]Musicals\n[edit]The Yale Dramatic Association performed the first musical production of The Great Gatsby in Summer 1956.[277][278] For the production, Aubrey L. Goodman adapted Fitzgerald's novel and wrote the lyrics for 14 songs by composer Robert E. Morgan. The show was performed in the University Theatre at Yale University to sold-out performances.[279] After the Yale production, a number of musical adaptations followed.A second musical adaptation debuted in Spring 1998, undertaken by Stage One, with Colin Stevens as Gatsby and Ann Marcuson as Jordan Baker.[280] Directed by Phil Smith with an original score by Thomas Johnson, this jazz adaptation premiered at the Pavilion Theatre in Rhyl, Wales. As a jazz adaptation, Johnson's original score emphasized saxophone and brass sextet instruments.[280]In 2023, the third musical adaptation, with music and lyrics by Jason Howland and Nathan Tysen and a book by Kait Kerrigan began a one-month limited engagement at the Paper Mill Playhouse.[281] The Broadway tryout began its previews on October 12, 2023, followed by an official opening night scheduled for ten days later. The production concluded on November 12 of the same year. Jeremy Jordan and Eva Noblezada starred as the leading roles of Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan, with Samantha Pauly and Noah J. Ricketts as Jordan Baker and Nick Carraway.[282] The production transferred to Broadway for previews on March 29, 2024, and opened officially on April 25th, 2024.[283][284]In Spring 2024, Gatsby: An American Myth, a fourth musical adaptation with music and lyrics by Florence Welch and Thomas Bartlett and a book by Martyna Majok premiered at the American Repertory Theater. The production starred Isaac Cole Powell as Jay Gatsby and Ben Levi Ross as Nick Carraway.[285] On May 25, 2024, the show began previews and opened officially on June 5 of the same year. It closed on August 3rd, 2024.Literature\n[edit]Since entering the public domain in 2021, retellings and expansions of The Great Gatsby have become legal to publish. Nick by Michael Farris Smith (2021) imagines the backstory of Nick Carraway.[286] That same year saw the publication of The Chosen and the Beautiful by Nghi Vo, a retelling with elements of the fantasy genre while tackling issues of race and sexuality,[287] and The Pursued and the Pursuing by AJ Odasso, a queer partial retelling and sequel in which Jay Gatsby survives.[288]Anna-Marie McLemore's own queer retelling, Self-Made Boys: A Great Gatsby Remix, was released in 2022 and was longlisted for the National Book Award for Young People's Literature.[289]Radio\n[edit]The novel has been adapted into a series of radio episodes. The first radio episode was a 1950 half-hour-long adaptation for CBS' Family Hour of Stars starring Kirk Douglas as Gatsby.[290] The novel was read aloud by the BBC World Service in ten parts in 2008. In a 2012 BBC Radio 4 broadcast, The Great Gatsby took the form of a Classic Serial dramatization. It was created by dramatist Robert Forrest.[291][292]Video games\n[edit]In 2010, Oberon Media released a casual hidden object game called Classic Adventures: The Great Gatsby.[293][294] In 2011, developer Charlie Hoey and editor Pete Smith created an 8-bit-style online game of The Great Gatsby called The Great Gatsby for NES;[295][296] in 2022, after the Adobe Flash end of life they adapted this game to an actual NES ROM file, which can also be played on their website.[297] In 2013, Slate released a short symbolic adaptation called The Great Gatsby: The Video Game.[298][299]^ Historian Jeff Nilsson described F. Scott Fitzgerald as the poet laureate of the Jazz Age, \"the most raucous, gaudy era in U.S. history\".[1]\n^ As a Southern belle, Zelda Sayre's wealthy family employed half-a-dozen domestic servants, many of whom were African-American.[23] She was unaccustomed to domestic labor of any kind and delegated all tasks to her servants.[24][25]\n^ In the original 1925 edition, Fitzgerald wrote that Gatsby and Nick served in the First Division. Fitzgerald revised the text in later editions to be the Third Division.[34]\n^ a b Throughout the novel, Fitzgerald identifies his native region of the Midwest—those \"towns beyond the Ohio\"—with the perceived virtuousness and rustic simplicity of the American West and as culturally distinct from the decadent values of the eastern United States.[248][249]\n^ Another possible model for Tom Buchanan was Southern polo champion and aviator Tommy Hitchcock Jr., whom Fitzgerald met at Long Island parties while in New York.[44]\n^ Primary sources such as Zelda Fitzgerald and F. Scott Fitzgerald's friend Edmund Wilson both stated that Max Gerlach was a neighbor.[37][69] Scholars have yet to find surviving property records for a Long Island residence with Gerlach's name.[70] However, there are likely \"gaps in the record of his addresses\",[70] and an accurate reconstruction of Gerlach's life and whereabouts is greatly hindered \"by the imperfect state of relevant documentation\".[71]\n^ In a 2009 book, scholar Horst Kruse asserts that Max Gerlach was born in or near Berlin, Germany, and, as a young boy, he immigrated with his German parents to America.[73]\n^ With the end of prohibition and the onset of the Great Depression, Max Gerlach lost his wealth. Living in poverty, he attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head in 1939.[75]\n^ Only two pages of the first draft of The Great Gatsby survive. Fitzgerald enclosed them with a letter to Willa Cather in 1925. They are now in the Fitzgerald Papers at Princeton University.[85]\n^ While Fitzgerald worked on the novel, his wife Zelda was romanced by French naval aviator Edouard Jozan and asked for a divorce.[99]\n^ In 2002, over six decades after Fitzgerald's death, his earlier draft of the now-famous novel was published under the title Trimalchio: An Early Version of The Great Gatsby.[112]\n^ Many years after The Great Gatsby's publication, Francis Cugat's original painting for the book cover was presumed forever lost until it was found in a trash can at Scribner's and donated to the Princeton University Libraries for its Graphic Arts Collection.[132]\n^ Daisy's statement that she hopes her daughter will be a \"beautiful little fool\" was said by Zelda Fitzgerald when their daughter Scottie was born on October 26, 1921, in a St. Paul hospital.[200]\n^ Fessenden (2005) argues that Fitzgerald struggled with his sexual orientation.[229] In contrast, Bruccoli (2002) insists that \"anyone can be called a latent homosexual, but there is no evidence that Fitzgerald was ever involved in a homosexual attachment\".[230]\n^ Scholars have focused on Fitzgerald's statement in a letter that his mind was \"half feminine\".[231] In 1935, Fitzgerald wrote to Laura Guthrie: \"I don't know what it is in me or that comes to me when I start to write. I am half feminine—at least my mind is\".[232]\n^ The spelling \"Wolfshiem\" appears throughout Fitzgerald's original manuscript, while \"Wolfsheim\" was introduced by editor Edmund Wilson in the second edition.[252] This appears in later Scribner's editions.[253]Citations\n[edit]^ Donahue 2013a.\n^ Fitzgerald 1945, p. 16, \"Echoes of the Jazz Age\".\n^ a b c Fitzgerald 1945, p. 18, \"Echoes of the Jazz Age\".\n^ Fitzgerald 1945, p. 15, \"Echoes of the Jazz Age\": \"Scarcely had the staider citizens of the republic caught their breaths when the wildest of all generations, the generation which had been adolescent during the confusion of the [Great] War, brusquely shouldered my contemporaries out of the way and danced into the limelight.

{"title":"Rebecca","author":"Daphne du Maurier","published":1938,"fiction":true,"plot":"While working as a companion to a rich American woman on holiday in Monte Carlo, the unnamed narrator, a naïve young woman in her early 20s, becomes acquainted with a wealthy Englishman, Maxim de Winter, a 42-year-old widower whose wife, Rebecca, drowned in a sailing accident one year earlier. After a fortnight of courtship, she agrees to marry him, becoming the second Mrs de Winter. After the wedding and honeymoon, accompanies him to his estate in Cornwall, Manderley, where she meets Mrs Danvers, housekeeper of Manderley and former lady's maid to Rebecca.Mrs Danvers continually attempts to undermine the narrator psychologically, suggesting to her that she will never attain the beauty and elegance her predecessor possessed. She shows the narrator the west wing of the house, which overlooks the sea. The west wing was formerly Rebecca's bedroom, which she has preserved as a shrine to her late mistress. When the narrator makes small requests, Mrs Danvers and the other staff describe how Rebecca ran Manderley when she was alive. Cowed by Mrs Danvers' imposing manner and the other members of West Country society's unwavering reverence for Rebecca, the narrator becomes isolated.The narrator is soon convinced that Maxim regrets his impetuous decision to marry her, and that he is still deeply in love with the seemingly perfect Rebecca. At the pressing of neighbours, Manderley hosts a costume ball, a custom Rebecca had instated. Mrs Danvers suggests the narrator wears a replica of the dress from a portrait of one of the house's former inhabitants. When the narrator enters the hall and Maxim sees the dress, he angrily orders her to change; Rebecca had worn the same costume to much acclaim shortly before her death.When confronted by the narrator, Mrs Danvers encourages her to commit suicide by jumping from Rebecca's bedroom window. However, she is interrupted by the disturbance caused by a nearby shipwreck. A diver investigating the wrecked ship's hull condition also discovers the remains of Rebecca's sailing boat, with her decomposed body still on board, despite Maxim having identified another body that had washed ashore two months after Rebecca's death.This discovery causes Maxim to confess to the narrator that his marriage to Rebecca was a sham. Rebecca, Maxim reveals, was a cruel and selfish woman who took many lovers while manipulating everyone around her into believing her to be the perfect wife and a paragon of virtue. On the night of her death, she taunted Maxim with the prospect of having another man's child, which she would raise under the pretense that it was Maxim's, and he would be unable to prove otherwise. Enraged, Maxim shot and killed Rebecca. He then disposed of her body by placing it in her boat and sinking it at sea. The narrator is relieved to hear that Maxim has always loved her and never Rebecca.Rebecca's boat is raised, and it is discovered to have been deliberately sunk. An inquest brings a verdict of suicide. However, Rebecca's first cousin and lover, Jack Favell, attempts to blackmail Maxim, claiming she could not have intended suicide based on a note she sent to him the night she died. It is revealed that Rebecca had had an appointment with a doctor in London shortly before her death, which the narrator suspects was to confirm a pregnancy. When the doctor is found, he reveals that Rebecca had cancer and would have died within a few months. Furthermore, due to the malformation of her uterus, she could never have been pregnant. Maxim assumes that Rebecca, knowing that she would die, manipulated him into killing her quickly. Mrs Danvers had said after the inquiry that Rebecca feared nothing except dying a lingering death.On hearing that Mrs Danvers has abruptly disappeared from Manderley, Maxim feels a great sense of foreboding and insists on driving through the night to return home. Before they come in sight of the house, it is clear from a glow on the horizon and wind-borne ashes that it is ablaze.Principal characters\n[edit]Minor characters\n[edit]In 1937, Daphne du Maurier signed a three-book deal with Victor Gollancz and accepted an advance of £1,000.[2] A 2008 article in The Daily Telegraph indicates she had been toying with the theme of jealousy for the five years since her marriage in 1932.[2] She started \"sluggishly\" and wrote a desperate apology to Gollancz: \"The first 15,000 words I tore up in disgust and this literary miscarriage has cast me down rather.\"[2]Her husband, Tommy \"Boy\" Browning, was Lieutenant Colonel of the Grenadier Guards and they were posted to Alexandria, Egypt, with the Second Battalion, leaving Britain on 30 July 1937.[2] Gollancz expected her manuscript on their return to Britain in December but she wrote that she was \"ashamed to tell you that progress is slow on the new novel...There is little likelihood of my bringing back a finished manuscript in December.\"[2]On returning to Britain in December 1937, du Maurier decided to spend Christmas away from her family to write the book and she successfully delivered it to her publisher less than four months later.[2] Du Maurier described the plot as \"a sinister tale about a woman who marries a widower....Psychological and rather macabre.\"[2]Derivation and inspiration\n[edit]Some commentators have noted parallels with Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre.[4][5] Another of du Maurier's works, Jamaica Inn, is also linked to one of the Brontë sisters' works, Emily's Wuthering Heights.[6]While du Maurier \"categorised Rebecca as a study in jealousy ... she admitted its origins in her own life to few.\"[2] Her husband had been previously engaged to Jan Ricardo, a glamorous dark-haired figure. Du Maurier was apparently haunted by the suspicion that Browning remained attracted to Ricardo.[2] In The Rebecca Notebook of 1981, du Maurier recalled the novel's gestation: \"Seeds began to drop. A beautiful home ... a first wife ... jealousy, a wreck, perhaps at sea, near to the house ... But something terrible would have to happen, I did not know what...\"[2] In her preliminary notes for the novel, she wrote: \"I want to build up the character of the first [wife] in the mind of the second...until wife 2 is haunted day and night...a tragedy is looming very close and CRASH! BANG! something happens.\"[2]Like Rebecca and Maximilian de Winter, du Maurier and her husband were not faithful to one another. Jan Ricardo eventually died by suicide during the Second World War, throwing herself under a train.[2]Du Maurier commented publicly in her lifetime that the book was based on her own memories of Menabilly and Cornwall, as well as her relationship with her father.[6] The depictions of Manderly may have been influenced by du Maurier's childhood visits to Milton Hall, Cambridgeshire (then in Northamptonshire) home of the Wentworth-Fitzwilliam family.[7]Plagiarism allegations\n[edit]Shortly after Rebecca was published in Brazil, critic Álvaro Lins pointed out many resemblances between du Maurier's book and the work of Brazilian writer Carolina Nabuco. Nabuco's A Sucessora (The Successor), published in 1934, has a main plot similar to Rebecca, for example a young woman marrying a widower and the strange presence of the first wife—plot features also shared with the far older Jane Eyre.[8] Nina Auerbach alleged in her book Daphne du Maurier, Haunted Heiress, that du Maurier read the English version of the Brazilian book when the first drafts were sent to the same publisher as hers in order to be published in England, and based her famous best-seller on it.Immediately following a 1941 article in The New York Times Book Review highlighting the two novels' many similarities,[9] du Maurier issued a rebuttal in a letter to the editor.[10] According to Nabuco's autobiography, Eight Decades, she (Nabuco) refused to sign an agreement brought to her by a United Artists' representative in which she would concede that the similarities between her book and the movie were mere coincidence.[11] A further, ironic complication in Nabuco's allegations is the similarity between her novel and the novel Encarnação, written by José de Alencar, one of Brazil's most celebrated novelists of the nineteenth century, and published posthumously in 1893.[12]In 1944, according to The Hollywood Reporter, du Maurier, her U.S. publishers Doubleday and United Artists, distributors of the film adaptation, were sued for plagiarism by Edwina Levin MacDonald who alleged that du Maurier had copied her 1927 novel Blind Windows, and sought an undisclosed amount of accounting and damages.[13] The complaint was eventually dismissed on 14 January 1948.[14][15]Du Maurier delivered the manuscript to her publisher, Victor Gollancz, in April 1938. On receipt, the book was read in Gollancz's office, and her \"editor, Norman Collins, reported simply: 'The new Daphne du Maurier contains everything that the public could want.'\"[2] Gollancz's \"reaction to Rebecca was relief and jubilation\" and \"a 'rollicking success' was predicted by him.\"[16] He \"did not hang around\" and \"ordered a first print run of 20,000 copies and within a month Rebecca had sold more than twice that number.\"[2] The novel has been continuously in print since 1938 and in 1993 \"du Maurier's US publishers Avon estimated ongoing monthly paperback sales of Rebecca at more than 4,000 copies.\"[2]Promotion\n[edit]Du Maurier \"did several radio interviews with BBC and other stations\" and \"attended Foyle's Literary Lunch\" in August 1938 while Good Housekeeping, Ladies Home Journal, and House & Garden published articles on du Maurier.[17]Print history\n[edit]Rebecca is listed in the 20th-Century American Bestsellers descriptive bibliography database maintained by the University of Illinois. The entry, by Katherine Huber, provided the detailed information on the English and American editions as well as translations listed below.English editions\n[edit]Translations\n[edit]The Times stated that \"the material is of the humblest ... nothing in this is beyond the novelette.\" In The Christian Science Monitor of 14 September 1938, V.S. Pritchett predicted the novel \"would be here today, gone tomorrow.\"[18]More recently, in a column for The Independent, the critics Ceri Radford and Chris Harvey recommended the book and argued that Rebecca is a \"marvellously gothic tale\" with a good dose of atmospheric and psychological horror.[19]Few critics saw in the novel what the author wanted them to see: the exploration of the relationship between a man who is powerful and a woman who is not.[20]In the U.S., du Maurier won the National Book Award for favourite novel of 1938, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association.[21] In 2003, the novel was listed at number 14 on the UK survey The Big Read.[22]In 2017, it was voted the UK's favourite book of the past 225 years in a poll by bookseller WHSmith. Other novels on the shortlist included To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë, and Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell.[23]On 5 November 2019, the BBC listed Rebecca on its list of the 100 most inspiring novels.[24]Film\n[edit]The best known theatrical film adaptation is the Academy Award–winning 1940 film version by Alfred Hitchcock,[25] the first film Hitchcock made under his contract with David O. Selznick. The film, which stars Laurence Olivier as Maxim, Joan Fontaine as his wife, and Dame Judith Anderson as Mrs Danvers, was based on the novel. However, the Hollywood Production Code required that if Maxim had murdered his wife, he would have to be punished for his crime. Therefore, the key turning point of the novel—the revelation that Maxim, in fact, murdered Rebecca—was altered so that Rebecca's death was accidental. This change had not been made in Orson Welles' previous radio play which included a promotion of the film. At the end of the film version, Mrs Danvers perishes in the fire, which she had started. The film quickly became a classic, and at the time, was a major technical achievement in film-making.[citation needed]An Indian film adaptation titled Kohraa followed in 1964, directed by Biren Nag, written by Dhruva Chatterjee, and starring Waheeda Rehman, Biswajeet and Lalita Pawar.In 2020, Netflix released an adaptation, directed by Ben Wheatley and written by Jane Goldman, starring Lily James as the second Mrs de Winter, Armie Hammer as Maxim, and Kristin Scott Thomas as Mrs Danvers.[26][27][28]Television\n[edit]Rebecca was adapted for The Philco Television Playhouse (10 October 1948), with Mary Anderson and Bramwell Fletcher;[29]Robert Montgomery Presents (22 May 1950), with Barbara Bel Geddes and Peter Cookson;[30] and Broadway Television Theatre (1 September 1952), with Patricia Breslin and Scott Forbes.[31]Theatre '62 presented an NBC-TV adaptation starring James Mason as Maxim, Joan Hackett as the second Mrs de Winter, and Nina Foch as Mrs Danvers.[32]Rebecca, a 1979 BBC adaptation, was directed by Simon Langton and starred Jeremy Brett as Maxim, Joanna David as the second Mrs de Winter, and Anna Massey (Jeremy Brett's former wife) as Mrs Danvers. It ran for four 55-minute episodes. It was broadcast in the United States on PBS as part of its Mystery! series.Rebecca, a 1997 Carlton Television drama serial, starred Emilia Fox (Joanna David's daughter, in the same role played by her mother in 1979), Charles Dance as de Winter, and Dame Diana Rigg as Mrs Danvers. It was directed by Jim O'Brien, with a screenplay by Arthur Hopcraft. It was broadcast in the United States by PBS as part of Masterpiece Theatre. This adaptation is noteworthy for featuring an appearance by Rebecca, played by Lucy Cohu. It also shows Maxim saving Mrs Danvers from the fire, ending with an epilogue showing Maxim and the second Mrs de Winter relaxing abroad, as she explains what she and Maxim do with their days now they are unlikely ever to return to Manderley.In 2008, a two-part Italian TV adaption, loosely based on the novel and named Rebecca, la prima moglie, aired on the national public broadcaster RAI. The episodes feature Alessio Boni as Maxim de Winter, Cristiana Capotondi as Jennifer de Winter and Mariangela Melato as Mrs Danvers.[33] The miniseries was filmed in Trieste.[34]Noor Pur Ki Rani, an Urdu language Pakistani drama television series adaptation directed by Haissam Hussain and dramatized by Pakistani writer and author Samira Fazal, was broadcast on Hum TV in 2009. The main role was played by Sanam Baloch.[35]Radio\n[edit]The first adaptation of Rebecca for any medium was presented 9 December 1938, by Orson Welles, as the debut program of his live CBS Radio series The Campbell Playhouse (the sponsored continuation of The Mercury Theatre on the Air). Introducing the story, Welles refers to the forthcoming motion picture adaptation by David O. Selznick; at the conclusion of the show he interviews Daphne du Maurier in London via shortwave radio. The novel was adapted by Howard E. Koch.[36]: 348  Welles and Margaret Sullavan starred as Max de Winter and the second Mrs de Winter. Other cast included Mildred Natwick (Mrs Danvers), Ray Collins (Frank Crawley), George Coulouris (Captain Searle), Frank Readick (as Ben), Alfred Shirley (Frith), Eustace Wyatt (Coroner) and Agnes Moorehead (Mrs Van Hopper).[37][38]Bernard Herrmann composed and conducted the score, which later formed the basis of his score for the 1943 film Jane Eyre.[39]: 67 The Screen Guild Theater presented half-hour adaptions with Joan Fontaine, her husband at the time Brian Aherne, and Agnes Moorehead (31 May 1943), and with Loretta Young, John Lund and Agnes Moorehead (18 November 1948).[40][41] Joan Fontaine and Joseph Cotten performed a half-hour adaptation 1 October 1946 on The Cresta Blanca Hollywood Players.[42]The Lux Radio Theatre presented hour-long adaptations with Ronald Colman, Ida Lupino and Judith Anderson (3 February 1941), and with Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh and Betty Blythe (6 November 1950).[43][44] These were tie-ins to the Hitchcock film, and perpetuated the censorship of the novel which the Hays Office had imposed on that film, although Orson Welles' radio version which predated the film (and including a promotion for the film) was faithful to the original, asserting that Max de Winter had deliberately murdered Rebecca.[45]Theatre\n[edit]Du Maurier herself adapted Rebecca as a stage play in 1939; it had a successful London run in 1940 of over 350 performances.[46][47] The popular Talking Books for the blind edition read by Barbara Caruso is based on this stage adaptation; it differs materially from the novel in many respects and includes a change to the original conclusion of the novel.[48]A Broadway stage adaptation starring Diana Barrymore, Bramwell Fletcher and Florence Reed ran 18 January – 3 February 1945, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre.[49]The stage adaptation of Rebecca was produced by the Brunton Theatre Company in Musselburgh, under the direction of Charles Nowosielski, in January and February 1990.[50][51]The book has also been adapted into a German-language musical, Rebecca, which opened in Vienna in 2006 and ran for three years.[52]Opera\n[edit]Rebecca was adapted as an opera with music by Wilfred Josephs, premiered by Opera North in Leeds, England, 15 October 1983.[53]The novel has inspired three additional books approved by the du Maurier estate:In addition, a number of fan fiction websites feature sequels, prequels, and adaptations of this novel.One edition of the book was used by the Germans in World War II as the key to a book code.[54] Sentences would be made using single words in the book, referred to by page number, line and position in the line. One copy was kept at Rommel's headquarters,[54] and the other was carried by German Abwehr agents infiltrated into Cairo after crossing Egypt by car, guided by Count László Almásy.[citation needed] This code never was used, however, because the radio section of the headquarters was captured in a skirmish and hence the Germans suspected that the code was compromised.[55]This use of the book is referred to in Ken Follett's novel The Key to Rebecca—where a (fictional) spy does use it to pass critical information to Rommel.[56] This use was also referenced in Michael Ondaatje's 1992 novel The English Patient.[57]Literature\n[edit]The book serves as an influence and is referenced several times throughout Stephen King's Bag of Bones, with several key elements from du Maurier's novel being recycled for King's novel. In the book, Mrs Danvers serves as something of a bogeyman for the main character Mike Noonan.In Jasper Fforde's Thursday Next series, thousands of Mrs Danvers clones are created.Television\n[edit]The 1970 Parallel Time storyline of the Gothic soap opera Dark Shadows was heavily inspired by Rebecca including the costume ball scene. The second Dark Shadows motion picture Night of Dark Shadows also took inspiration from the novel.The film was parodied on The Carol Burnett Show in a 1972 skit called \"Rebecky\", with Carol Burnett as the heroine, Daphne; Harvey Korman as Max \"de Wintry\" and in the guise of Mother Marcus as Rebecky de Wintry; and Vicki Lawrence as Mrs Dampers.[58][59]Another parody of the story is found in the second series of the sketch show That Mitchell and Webb Look from 2008. The sketch, which stars Robert Webb as Maxim, David Mitchell as Mrs Danvers, and Jo Neary as Rebecca, explores an alternate approach to a filmatization of the novel. Here, the story is narrated by Rebecca, who is haunted by the household's anticipation of a second Mrs De Winter.[60][61]The plots of some Latin-American soap operas have also been inspired by the novel, such as Manuela (Argentina),[62]Infierno en el paraíso (Mexico),[63] the Venezuelan telenovela Julia and its remake El Fantasma de Elena on Telemundo, and \"La Sombra de Belinda\" a telenovela from Puerto Rico.Music\n[edit]Meg & Dia's Meg Frampton penned a song titled \"Rebecca\", inspired by the novel.Kansas alumnus Steve Walsh's solo recording Glossolalia includes a song titled \"Rebecca\" with the lyrics: \"I suppose I was the lucky one, returning like a wayward son to Manderley, I'd never be the same...\"Steve Hackett included a song titled \"Rebecca\" on his album To Watch the Storms.Taylor Swift's song \"Tolerate It\", featured on her album Evermore, is inspired by the novel.[64]Fashion\n[edit]In 2013, Devon watchmakers Du Maurier Watches, founded by the grandson of Daphne du Maurier, released a limited edition collection of two watches inspired by the characters from the novel—The Rebecca and The Maxim.[65]^ \"Rebecca the eagerly awaited novel by Daphne du Maurier COMING THIS FRIDAY\".

{"title":"The Revolt of Mamie Stover","author":"William Bradford Huie","published":1951,"fiction":true,"plot":"The Revolt of Mamie Stover is an allegory for the decline of American society because of the country-wide democratization that conflict made possible. Using a Honolulu prostitute to state his case, Huie shows her rise economically, socially, and politically with the aid, in part, of the federal government as she flouts local regulation (prostitution itself being legal at the time). As the war progresses, Stover becomes a war profiteer, coming to control property, accumulating vast wealth in cash, and visiting proscribed beaches in the company of U.S. military officers.The Revolt of Mamie Stover is the first volume in a trilogy, including The Americanization of Emily (1959), and Hotel Mamie Stover (1963), all of which have the same narrator. In the first and third books, he is primarily present in order to observe and report, and in the second he relates his experiences in the late stages of World War II.A movie version directed by Raoul Walsh was released in 1956 with Jane Russell in the title role. The screenplay essentially dropped the Hollywood critique.[citation needed]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}\"William B Huie, 76; Southern Author\".

{"title":"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo","author":"Stieg Larsson","published":2005,"fiction":true,"plot":"Middle-aged journalist Mikael Blomkvist, who publishes the magazine Millennium in Stockholm, has lost a libel case involving damaging allegations about billionaire Swedish industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerström, and is sentenced to three months in prison. Facing jail time and professional disgrace, Blomkvist steps down from his position on the magazine's board of directors, despite strong objections from Erika Berger, Blomkvist's longtime friend, occasional lover, and business partner. At the same time, he is offered an unlikely freelance assignment by Henrik Vanger, the elderly former CEO of Vanger Enterprises. Blomkvist accepts the assignment, unaware that Vanger commissioned gifted private investigator Lisbeth Salander to comprehensively investigate Blomkvist's personal and professional history.Blomkvist visits Vanger at his estate on the tiny island of Hedeby, several hours from Stockholm. The old man convinces Blomkvist to do the assignment, by promising not only financial reward but also solid evidence that Wennerström is truly the scoundrel Blomkvist suspects him to be. On this basis, Blomkvist agrees to spend a year writing the Vanger family history as a cover for the real assignment: solving the \"cold case\" of the disappearance of Vanger's great niece Harriet some 40 years earlier. Vanger expresses his suspicion that Harriet was murdered by a member of the vast Vanger family, many of whom were present in Hedeby on the day of her disappearance. Each year on his birthday Harriet gave Henrik a present of pressed flowers. Since her murder, each year on his birthday, the murderer torments him with a present of pressed flowers, explains Vanger.Blomkvist begins to analyze the volumes of information that Vanger has obsessively compiled over 40 years about the circumstances of Harriet's disappearance. Hedeby is home to several generations of Vangers, all part-owners in Vanger Enterprises. Under the pretext of researching the family history, and because the island is small, Blomkvist soon becomes acquainted with the members of the extended family who are variously mad, uninterested, concerned, hostile, or aloof.Blomkvist immerses himself in the case. Eventually Lisbeth Salander is brought in, now to assist him with research by using her skills as a computer hacker. Ultimately the two discover that Harriet's brother Martin, now CEO of Vanger Industries, has been systematically abusing and killing women for years. Moreover, the behavior was indoctrinated in him by his late father Gottfried who sexually abused Martin and Harriet as well. Blomkvist tries to confront Martin, but is captured and taken to a torture chamber hidden in Martin's house. Martin reveals that he is not responsible for Harriet's disappearance. Moments before Martin can kill Blomkvist, Lisbeth bursts in and frees him. Martin escapes but commits suicide by crashing his car into a truck on the highway.Blomkvist and Lisbeth realize that Harriet was not murdered, but ran away to escape from her sadistic brother. They track her in Australia where she runs a sheep farming company. Confronted, she confirms their account of the case, and reveals that she was responsible for the presumed accidental death of her father. She returns to Sweden where she is happily reunited with Vanger and begins to take a leading role in the newly leaderless family company.The evidence about Wennerström, which Vanger promised, turns out to be weak, and the promises turn out to have been mostly a lure for Blomkvist. But Lisbeth breaks into Wennerström's computer and discovers that his crimes go beyond what Blomkvist had published. Using this evidence, Blomkvist publishes an article and a book which destroy Wennerström and raise Blomkvist and Millennium to national prominence.Larsson refers to several classic forerunners in the same genre and comments on contemporary Swedish society.[9] Reviewer Robert Dessaix writes, \"His favourite targets are violence against women, the incompetence and cowardice of investigative journalists, the moral bankruptcy of big capital and the virulent strain of Nazism still festering ... in Swedish society.\"[1] Cecilia Ovesdotter Alm and Anna Westerstahl Stenport write that the novel \"reflects—implicitly and explicitly—gaps between rhetoric and practice in Swedish policy and public discourse about complex relations between welfare state retrenchment, neoliberal corporate and economic practices, and politicised gender construction. According to one article, the novel endorses a pragmatic acceptance of a neoliberal world order that is delocalized, dehumanized and misogynistic.\"[10]Alm and Stenport add, \"What most international (and Swedish) reviewers overlook is that the financial and moral corruptibility at the heart of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is so profound as to indict most attributes associated with contemporary Sweden as democratic and gender-equal. American critic Maureen Corrigan called it an \"unflinching ... commonsense feminist social commentary\".[11][10]Larsson further enters the debate as to how responsible criminals are for their crimes, and how much is blamed on upbringing or society.[1] For instance, Salander has a strong will and assumes that everyone else does, too. She is portrayed as having suffered every kind of abuse in her young life, including an unnecessary commitment to a psychiatric clinic and subsequent instances of sexual assault suffered at the hands of her court-appointed guardian.Maria de Lurdes Sampaio, in the journal Cross-Cultural Communication, asserts that, \"Blomkvist, a modern Theseus, leads us to the labyrinth of the globalized world, while the series' protagonist, Lisbeth Salander, modeled on the Amazon, is an example of the empowerment of women in crime fiction by playing the role of the 'tough guy' detective, while also personifying the popular roles of the victim, the outcast and the avenger.\" In this context, she discusses \"Dialogues with Greek tragedy... namely Salander's struggles with strong father figures.\" Sampaio also argues,The novel was released to great acclaim in Sweden and later, on its publication in many other European countries. In the original language, it won Sweden's Glass Key Award in 2006 for best crime novel of the year. It also won the 2008 Boeke Prize, and in 2009 the Galaxy British Book Awards[13] for Books Direct Crime Thriller of the Year, and the prestigious Anthony Award[14][15] for Best First Novel. The Guardian ranked The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo at 98 in its list of 100 Best Books of the 21st Century.[16] Larsson was awarded the ITV3 Crime Thriller Award for International Author of the Year in 2008.[17]It debuted at number four on The New York Times Best Seller list.[10]Alex Berenson wrote in The New York Times, \"The novel offers a thoroughly ugly view of human nature\"; while it \"opens with an intriguing mystery\" and the \"middle section of Girl is a treat, the rest of the novel doesn't quite measure up. The book's original Swedish title was Men Who Hate Women, a label that just about captures the subtlety of the novel's sexual politics.\"[18] The Los Angeles Times said \"the book takes off, in the fourth chapter: From there, it becomes classic parlor crime fiction with many modern twists....The writing is not beautiful, clipped at times (though that could be the translation by Reg Keeland) and with a few too many falsely dramatic endings to sections or chapters. But it is a compelling, well-woven tale that succeeds in transporting the reader to rural Sweden for a good crime story.\"[19] Several months later, Matt Selman said the book \"rings false with piles of easy super-victories and far-fetched one-in-a-million clue-findings.\"[20] Richard Alleva, in the Catholic journal,Commonweal, wrote that the novel is marred by \"its inept backstory, banal characterizations, flavorless prose, surfeit of themes (Swedish Nazism, uncaring bureaucracy, corporate malfeasance, abuse of women, etc.), and—worst of all—author Larsson's penchant for always telling us exactly what we should be feeling.\"[21]On the other hand, Dr. Abdallah Daar, writing for Nature, said, \"The events surrounding the great-niece's disappearance are meticulously and ingeniously pieced together, with plenty of scientific insight.\"[22] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote, \"It's a big, intricately plotted, darkly humorous work, rich with ironies, quirky but believable characters and a literary playfulness that only a master of the genre and its history could bring off.\"[23]The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo sold more than 30 million copies by 2010.[24] In the United States, it sold more than 3.4 million copies in hardcover or ebook formats, and 15 million total by June 2011.[25]Wiley published a collection of essays, edited by Eric Bronson, titled The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and Philosophy (2011).[26]Main articles: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009 film) and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011 film)^ a b c Dessaix, Robert (22 February 2008). \"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\".

{"title":"The Lost Symbol","author":"Dan Brown","published":2009,"fiction":true,"plot":"Renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is invited to give a lecture at the United States Capitol, at the invitation apparently from his mentor, a 33rd degree Mason named Peter Solomon, who is the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Solomon has also asked him to bring a small, sealed package which he had entrusted to Langdon years earlier. When Langdon arrives at the Capitol, however, he learns that the invitation he received was not from Solomon, but from Solomon's kidnapper, Mal'akh posing as Solomon's assistant, who has left Solomon's severed right hand in the middle of the Capitol Rotunda in a recreation of the Hand of Mysteries. Mal'akh then contacts Langdon, charging him with finding both the Mason's Pyramid, which Masons believe is hidden somewhere in Washington, D.C., and the Lost Word, lest Solomon be murdered.Langdon meets Inoue Sato, the head of the CIA's Office of Security. Sato claims that Mal'akh poses a threat to the national security of the U.S. and that his capture is more important than Peter's rescue, although she refuses to elaborate. Examining Solomon's hand, they discover a clue leading them to Solomon's Masonic altar in a room in the Capitol's sub-basement, where they find a small pyramid lacking a capstone, with an inscription carved into it. Sato then confronts Langdon with the security x-ray taken of his bag when he entered the Capitol which reveals a smaller pyramid in the package Langdon brought in response to the request by the kidnapper posing as Solomon's assistant. Langdon explains that he was unaware of its contents, but Sato, refusing to believe it, attempts to take Langdon into custody. Before she can arrest him, however, she and Capitol Police Chief Trent Anderson are assaulted by Warren Bellamy, the Architect of the Capitol and a Freemason, who then flees with Langdon in the confusion. He later explains to Langdon that he too has been in contact with Mal'akh and wants Langdon's assistance in rescuing Peter.Mal'akh is revealed to be a Freemason with tattoos covering almost his entire body. He infiltrated the organization in order to obtain an ancient source of power,[9] which he believes Langdon can unlock for him in return for Peter Solomon's life. Several chapters also delve into Mal'akh's history with Peter Solomon: many years earlier, Peter bequeathed a large sum of inheritance money to his rebellious son, Zachary, who then fled the Solomon household and led a reckless life in Europe until he was arrested and imprisoned in Turkey for smuggling drugs. Peter flew to Turkey and was given the chance to obtain his immediate release in exchange for a bribe, but decided to have Zachary extradited in a week's time in order to teach him a lesson about using money to avoid the consequences of one's actions. Zachary was apparently murdered by his cellmate who got his hands on Zachary's fortune and fled to the island of Syros in Greece to lead a luxurious life under the name Andros Dareios. Dareios, however, soon grew tired of his life. Apparently having spoken with Zachary about Solomon's life as a Mason, Dareios broke into Solomon's home to find the pyramid, but accidentally killed Peter's mother Isabel and was in turn shot and left to fall into a frozen river by a vengeful Solomon. Surviving the fall, Dareios nursed himself back to health, covered his scars and eventually his entire body with tattoos and set off on a mission to infiltrate the Freemasons and gain access to their secrets, adopting the name Mal'akh.As Langdon deals with the events into which he has been thrust, Mal'akh destroys the Smithsonian-sponsored laboratory of Dr. Katherine Solomon, Peter's younger sister, where she has conducted experiments in Noetic science. In the process, Mal'akh ambushes and almost kills Katherine in a cat-and-mouse chase, but Katherine manages to escape and meet up with Langdon and Bellamy. Eventually, when cornered by the authorities, Bellamy is forced to give himself up while Langdon and Katherine escape. Both are later apprehended by Sato's team. Following clues regarding Mal'akh's previous identity as Peter Solomon's psychiatrist, Dr. Christopher Abaddon, Sato allows Langdon and Katherine to rush to his mansion to confront him, but Mal'akh ambushes them and murders their CIA escort. Meanwhile, as he is being interrogated by Sato, Bellamy expresses belief that Sato is working with Mal'akh but Sato assures Bellamy that she is also pursuing Mal'akh in the interest of national security and displays evidence that visibly shocks Bellamy.Mal'akh places Langdon into an airtight sensory deprivation tank, where he interrogates Langdon by slowly filling the tank with liquid. He is able to convince Langdon to decipher the code at the pyramid's base, but continues to fill the tank until Langdon drowns and apparently dies. Mal'akh then ties Katherine to a chair and inserts an open-ended transfusion needle into her arm and leaves her to bleed to death then flees with a weakened Peter Solomon to the Temple Room of the Scottish Rite's House of the Temple. He uses the threat of not calling an ambulance for Katherine as further coercion for Peter's cooperation. Sato leads a team of agents to the mansion after Langdon and Katherine's escort fails to check in and are able to save Katherine's life. After a near-death experience, Langdon is revealed to have survived due to the \"water\" in the tank actually being breathable oxygenated liquid and the tank being a device for meditation. Sato and Langdon race to the House of the Temple where Mal'akh threatens to release a heavily edited video showing government officials performing secret Masonic rituals (the same video that Sato showed to Bellamy), which without context, appears highly disturbing. Mal'akh forces the Word—the unpronounceable circumpunct—out of Peter and tattoos it on his head on the last portion of unmarked skin on his body. Mal'akh then orders Peter to sacrifice him, as he believes that it is his destiny to become a demonic spirit and lead the forces of evil. When Peter claims that he will do so without hesitation to avenge his son and mother, Mal'akh shocks Peter by revealing that he is actually Zachary Solomon himself, having conspired with the prison warden to fake his death by disfiguring the body of another inmate beyond recognition (at the same time, Katherine and Bellamy discover several photos of Zachary in Greece after his supposed death that show his gradual transformation into Mal'akh). With tears in his eyes, Peter prepares to stab Zachary but ultimately cannot bring himself to do so and drops the knife just as Langdon arrives and tackles him. Director Sato arrives at the Temple in a helicopter, which smashes the Temple's skylight, the shards of which fatally impale Zachary. The CIA then thwart Zachary's plan to transmit the video to several leading media channels using an EMP blast, disabling a cell tower in the network path leading from Zachary's laptop computer. Katherine arrives and she and Langdon then share a tearful reunion with Peter and mourn Zachary's death. Zachary is only briefly able to lament his body's mutilation before dying.Later, Peter informs Langdon that the circumpunct Zachary tattooed on his head is not the Word. He also informs Katherine that he made back-ups of all of her Noetic research data on his own computer, meaning her research can continue. Deciding to take Langdon to the true secret behind the Word, Peter leads him to the room atop the Washington Monument and tells him that the Word—a common Christian Bible, the Word of God—lies in the monument's cornerstone, buried in the ground beneath the monument's staircase. Langdon realizes that the words inscribed in the base of aluminum capstone (Masonic pyramid) atop the Monument spelled out Laus Deo which translate to \"Praise God\". Peter tells Langdon that the Masons believe that the Bible is an esoteric allegory written by humanity, and that, like most religious texts around the globe, it contains veiled instructions for harnessing humanity's natural God-like qualities—similar to Katherine's noetic research—and is not meant to be interpreted as the commands of an all-powerful deity. This interpretation has been lost amid centuries of scientific skepticism and fundamentalist zealotry. The Masons have (metaphorically) buried it, believing that, when the time is right, its rediscovery will usher in a new era of human enlightenment.The Lost Symbol had been in development for several years; originally expected in 2006, the projected publication date was pushed back multiple times.[14] When officially announced, the hardcopy book was on pre-order lists for months leading up to its release, being heavily ordered both in the United States and Canada.[15][16] The book was published on September 15, 2009, with an initial print run of 6.5 million copies, the largest first printing in publisher Random House's history.[17][18] Electronic versions such as eBook[19] and Audible book versions[20] were also made available on the same date.[21] The American release audio book was read by Paul Michael, who also performed the audio book for The Da Vinci Code.The book immediately broke sales records, becoming the fastest selling adult-market novel in history, with over one million copies sold on the first day of release. By the end of the first week, a total of two million copies had been sold in the U.S., Canada, and UK.[22] According to the publisher, the rapid sales prompted the printing of an additional 600,000 hardcover copies to the 5 million initially printed for the US market.[5] On its first day the book became the #1 bestseller on Amazon.com,[23] and the Amazon Kindle e-reader edition became the top-selling item on Amazon.com, outselling Amazon's sales of the hardback copy of the novel, which is the sixth best selling book of 2009 on pre-publication orders alone.[24]The Lost Symbol also ranked as the #1 bestseller in Amazon's Canadian and British sites.[25][26] Both Barnes & Noble and Waterstone's reported the book has broken all previous records for adult fiction in the United Kingdom.[27][28] According to Nielsen BookScan data, 550,946 copies of The Lost Symbol were sold in its first week of sale, taking $7.49 million. By the end of the second sales week, Transworld intended to have 1.25 million copies printed.[29]By September 25, the book ranked No. 1 in the New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover fiction.[6]Reception\n[edit]The New York Times praised the book as being \"impossible to put down\" and claimed Brown is \"bringing sexy back to a genre that had been left for dead.\" Nevertheless, it noted the overuse of certain phrases and italics, as well as the lack of logic behind characters' motivations. It also likened Inoue Sato to Jar Jar Binks.[30]Los Angeles Times said, \"Brown's narrative moves rapidly, except for those clunky moments when people sound like encyclopedias.\"[31]Newsweek called the book \"contrived\", saying that to get through The Lost Symbol, just like The Da Vinci Code, it was necessary to swallow a lot of coincidences, but the book was still a page-turner, and that Brown \"is a maze maker who builds a puzzle and then walks you through it. His genius lies in uncovering odd facts and suppressed history, stirring them together into a complicated stew and then saying, what if?'\"[32] The National Post's review called it a \"heavy-handed, clumsy thriller\" and that the character of the villain (Mal'akh) \"bears an uncomfortably close similarity\" to the Francis Dolarhyde character in Thomas Harris' 1981 novel Red Dragon.[33]The Daily Telegraph said the novel was \"not quite the literary train-wreck expected\".[34]Time said the plot was fun, if bruising, but \"It would be irresponsible not to point out that the general feel, if not all the specifics, of Brown's cultural history is entirely correct. He loves showing us places where our carefully tended cultural boundaries — between Christian and pagan, sacred and secular, ancient and modern — are actually extraordinarily messy.\"[35]Novelist William Sutcliffe's review in the Financial Times panned the book as \"a novel that asks nothing of the reader, and gives the reader nothing back\", adding that it \"is filled with cliché, bombast, undigested research and pseudo-intellectual codswallop\".[36] The digested read by John Crace in The Guardian ends with Robert Langdon begging Dan Brown \"Please don't wheel me out again.\"[37] Slovene philosopher and cultural critic Slavoj Žižek described the book as \"a candidate for the worst novel ever\".[38]Cancelled film\n[edit]Following the worldwide successes of The Da Vinci Code in 2006[39] and Angels & Demons in 2009,[40] which were both based on Brown's novels, starring Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon and produced and directed by Ron Howard, Columbia Pictures began production on a film adaptation of The Lost Symbol.[41][42] Hanks and Howard were expected to return for the film adaptation of The Lost Symbol, along with the franchise's producers Brian Grazer and John Calley. Sony Pictures eventually hired three screenwriters for the project, beginning with Steven Knight[43] and then hiring Brown himself.[44] In March 2012, Danny Strong was also hired to collaborate on the adaptation.[45] Howard had eventually bowed out of directing, and Mark Romanek was being looked at to replace him.[46]According to a January 2013 article in Los Angeles Times, the final draft of the screenplay was due sometime in February, with pre-production expected to start in the mid-2013.[8] In July 2013, Sony Pictures announced they would instead adapt Inferno for an October 14, 2016,[47] release date with Howard as director, David Koepp adapting the screenplay and Hanks reprising his role as Robert Langdon.[48]Television series\n[edit]Main article: The Lost Symbol (TV series)In June 2019, the project was announced to be re-conceived as a television series tentatively titled Langdon. The series will serve as a prequel to the film series, with Dan Dworkin and Jay Beattie serving as co-creators, showrunners and executive producers. Dan Brown, Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, Francie Calfo, Samie Falvey and Anna Culp will act as additional executive producers. The show will be a co-production between Imagine Television Studios, CBS Studios, and Universal Television Studios and was ordered to series on NBC. In March 2021, it was announced that the series was picked up to series by Peacock.[49] In January 2022, the series was canceled after one season.[50]^ Italie, Hillel (April 20, 2009). \"New Dan Brown novel coming in September\".

{"title":"James and the Giant Peach","author":"Roald Dahl","published":1961,"fiction":true,"plot":"Set in the summer of 1948, James Henry Trotter is a boy who lives happily with his parents in a house by the sea in the south of England. Unfortunately, when he is four years old, an oddly carnivorous raging rhinoceros escapes from the London Zoo and eats James' parents whilst they are on a shopping trip in the capital. He ends up in the care of his two cruel aunts, Aunty Spiker and Aunty Sponge, who physically and verbally abuse him, isolate him in their ramshackle hilltop house and garden, dole out sadistic punishments for the smallest infractions, force him to sleep on bare floorboards in a prison cell-like room, and force him to do heavy chores most of the time that they never bother doing themselves (they also do not call him by his real name, but insults like \"you disgusting little beast\" or \"you miserable creature\").One day, after James has been living with his aunts for three years, when he's sent behind a clump of laurel bushes for only requesting a day trip to the seaside, he meets a mysterious man who gives him a bag of magical crystals, instructing James to use them in a potion that would change his life for the better. While returning home, James stumbles and spills the bag on the ground, losing the crystals as they dig themselves underground next to a nearby barren peach tree. Immediately, the tree, in turn, produces a single peach which soon grows to the size of a house. The next day, Spiker and Sponge build a fence around it and earn money by selling viewing tickets to tourists; James is locked in the house, only able to see the peach and the crowds through the bars of his bedroom window.After the tourists have gone, James is assigned to clean the rubbish around the peach and finds a hole inside it. He crawls in, through a tunnel, and he finds himself in a room, in the enlarged peach pit. There, he meets Centipede, Miss Spider, Old Green Grasshopper, Earthworm, Ladybug, Glowworm, and Silkworm who become his friends and express their dreams of leaving Spiker and Sponge's hill as their lives, like James', have been made miserable by the two aunts.The next day, Centipede cuts the stem of the peach, causing it to roll away and crush James' aunts to death. After leaving behind a trail of minor destruction (including crashing through a chocolate factory), it reaches the sea and is surrounded by ravenous sharks. James uses Miss Spider and Silkworm to make threads, while Earthworm is used as bait and draws 501 seagulls[7] to the peach, whereupon the threads are tied on their necks. The peach is lifted off the water. High above the clouds, during the journey, while James learns about his friends' lives before they encountered each other, the Centipede accidentally falls overboard, but gets rescued by James.As night falls, the peach encounters the Cloud-Men, who are portrayed as responsible for weather phenomena like hailstorms and rainbows. Centipede mocks the Cloud-Men, who throw things at the group until they get clear. The peach briefly gets entangled in the ropes holding up a rainbow, making a Cloud-Man jump onto one of the seagull strings, which the Centipede cuts loose. In retaliation for the loss of one of their friends, the Cloud-Men hurl cans of rainbow paint, which coat the Centipede in fast drying rainbow paint that freezes him into a statue. Afterwards, the travelers barely escape the Cloud-Men's faucets that make the rain, which frees the Centipede. Almost before dawn, as they leave the Cloud-Men's homes behind, the group briefly encounters a giant bat.As morning finally dawns, James sees that the group has reached New York City and arranges for some seagulls to be let loose for them to land. After doing so, however, the wing of a passing plane severs the rest of the strings, and the falling peach lands on the spire of the Empire State Building. It is mistaken for a bomb at first and then a spaceship, resulting in the arrival of police and firemen. Calming the crowd, James tells his story, and becomes friends with many children in New York; they eat the peach and James and his friends get their own jobs, now residing in Central Park, in the pit of the peach. As James gets many requests to tell about his adventures on the giant peach, he resorts to write a book about it and does so, revealing to the reader that they've just finished reading the very book.See also: Roald Dahl revision controversyDespite Roald Dahl having enjoined his publishers not to \"so much as change a single comma in one of my books\", in February 2023 Puffin Books, a division of Penguin Books, announced it would be re-writing portions of many of Dahl's children's novels, changing the language to, in the publisher's words, \"ensure that it can continue to be enjoyed by all today\".[8] The decision was met with sharp criticism from groups and public figures including authors Salman Rushdie[9][10] and Christopher Paolini,[11] British prime minister Rishi Sunak,[9][10]Queen Camilla,[9][12]Kemi Badenoch,[13]PEN America,[9][10] and Brian Cox.[13] Dahl's publishers in the United States, France, and the Netherlands announced they had declined to incorporate the changes.[9]In James and the Giant Peach, more than seventy changes were made, such as removing references to Sponge as fat (including writing an entirely new poem), changing queer to strange, removing references to skin colour (such as \"his face white with horror\", \"looking white and thin\", and the Earthworm's \"lovely pink skin\"), and changing Cloud-Men to Cloud-People.[14][15]Film adaptations\n[edit]Main article: James and the Giant Peach (film)A television adaptation of the novel appeared on BBC One on December 28, 1976. Paul Stone directed a script by Trever Preston. The cast included Simon Bell playing James, Bernard Cribbins playing Centipede, and Anna Quayle playing Aunt Spiker.[16]Though Roald Dahl declined numerous offers during his life to have a film version of James and the Giant Peach produced, his widow, Felicity Dahl, approved an offer to have a film adaptation produced in conjunction with Disney in the mid-1990s.[17] It was directed by Henry Selick and produced by Denise Di Novi and Tim Burton, all of whom previously made The Nightmare Before Christmas. The movie consists of live action and stop-motion to reduce production finances.[18] It was narrated by Pete Postlethwaite (who also played the old man) and featured five songs composed and written by Randy Newman. The film was released on April 12, 1996.[19] Although it was a box office failure, it received positive reviews and eventually became a cult classic upon its release on home video.There are numerous changes in both the plot of the film and the plot of the book (notably, the aunts survive the rolling peach and follow James all the way to New York City and the absence of the Silkworm), though the film was generally well-received. Felicity Dahl said that, \"I think Roald would have been delighted with what they did with James.\"[17]Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised the animated part, but calling the live-action segments \"crude\".[20] Newman was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score.In August 2016, Sam Mendes was in negotiations with Disney to direct another live action adaptation of the novel,[21] with Nick Hornby in talks for the script.[22] In May 2017, Mendes was no longer attached to the project due to his entering talks with Disney about directing a live-action film adaptation of Pinocchio.[23]Musical adaptation\n[edit]Main article: James and the Giant Peach (musical)The book was made into a musical with music and lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul and book by Timothy Allen McDonald. The musical had its premiere at Goodspeed Musicals on 21 October 2010, and is currently produced in regional and youth theatre.[24][25]Stage adaptation\n[edit]David Wood's play based on James and the Giant Peach has been performed worldwide. It was first produced in 2001 by the Sherman Theatre, Cardiff and Birmingham Stage Company, who then toured it all over the UK. Other major productions have been mounted by West Yorkshire Playhouse and Polka Theatre, and it is very popular with community and amateur companies in the UK and US. The play is published and licensed by Concord Theatricals.[26]Theatrical adaptation\n[edit]Ray DaSilva's Norwich Puppet Theatre put on puppet theatre performances in 1985.[27]Audiobooks\n[edit]The book has been recorded a number of times, including:Charity readings\n[edit]In May 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Taika Waititi, the Oscar-winning director, worked with the Roald Dahl Story Company to publish audio-visual readings of the book. Waititi was joined by Oscar-winning actresses Meryl Streep, Lupita Nyong'o, and Cate Blanchett; actors Benedict Cumberbatch, Liam and Chris Hemsworth, Ryan Reynolds; the Duchess of Cornwall, and others in ten installments which were then published to the Roald Dahl YouTube channel.[31]The event was organised to raise money for the global-non profit Partners In Health, founded by Dahl's daughter Ophelia, which had been fighting COVID-19 in vulnerable areas; with Roald Dahl Story Co. committing to match donations up to $1million.[31] Waititi had already been working with the company as the writer, director, and executive producer for Netflix's upcoming serialised adaption of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.[32]^ \"Roald Dahl Fact Sheet: Puffin play ground\".

{"title":"A Brief History of Time","author":"Stephen Hawking","published":1988,"fiction":true,"plot":"Chapter 1: Our Picture of the Universe\n[edit]Hawking begins with an anecdote about a scientist lecturing on the universe. An old woman got up and said, \"What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise.\" The scientist asked what the tortoise was standing on. She replied, \"You're very clever young man, very clever. But it's turtles all the way down!\"[5] Hawking goes on to explain why we know better.He discusses the history of astronomy, starting with Aristotle's conclusions about a spherical Earth and a circular geocentric model of the universe, later elaborated upon by the second-century Greek astronomer Ptolemy. He discusses the development of the heliocentric model of the Solar System by the Polish astronomer Nicholas Copernicus in 1514. A century later, the Italian Galileo Galilei turned a Dutch spyglass to the heavens. His observations of Jupiter's moons provided support for Copernicus. The German astronomer Johannes Kepler formulated his laws of planetary motion, in which planets move in ellipses. Kepler's laws were explained by English physicist Isaac Newton in his Principia Mathematica (1687).Hawking discusses how the subject of the origin of the universe has been debated over time: the perennial existence of the universe hypothesized by Aristotle and other early philosophers was opposed by St. Augustine and other theologians' belief in its creation at a specific time in the past. Immanuel Kant argued that time had no beginning. In our time, the discovery of the expanding universe implied that between 10 billion and 20 billion years ago, the entire universe was contained in one singular extremely dense place, and that it doesn't make sense to ask what happened before. He writes: \"An expanding universe does not preclude a creator, but it does place limits on when he might have carried out his job!\"[6]Chapter 2: Space and Time\n[edit]Hawking describes the evolution of scientific thought regarding the nature of space and time. He starts with the Aristotelian idea that the naturally preferred state of a body is to be at rest, and it can only be moved by force, implying that heavier objects will fall faster. However, Galileo experimentally disproved Aristotle's theory by observing the motion of objects of different weights and concluding that all objects would fall at the same rate. This led to Newton's laws of motion and gravity. However, Newton's laws implied that there is no such thing as absolute state of rest or absolute space: whether an object is 'at rest' or 'in motion' depends on the observer's inertial frame of reference.Hawking describes the classical belief in absolute time, that observers in motion will measure the same time. However, Hawking writes that this commonsense notion does not work at or near the speed of light. That light travels at a finite speed was discovered by Ole Rømer through his observations of Jupiter and its moons. Scottish scientist James Clerk Maxwell's equations unifying electricity and magnetism predicted the existence of waves moving at a fixed speed, the same speed that had been measured for light. Physicists believed that light must travel through a luminiferous aether, and that the speed of light was relative to that of the aether. The Michelson–Morley experiment, designed to detect the speed of light through the aether, got a null result. Michelson and Morley found that the speed of light was constant regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. In 1905, Albert Einstein argued that the aether is superfluous if we abandon absolute time. His special theory of relativity is based on two postulates: the laws of physics are the same for all observers moving relative to one another, and the speed of light is a universal constant.Remarkable consequences follow. Mass and energy are related by the equation E=mc2{\\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}, which means that an infinite amount of energy is needed for any object with mass to travel at the speed of light (c = 3×108 m/s). It follows that no material body can travel at or beyond the speed of light. A 4-dimensional spacetime is described, in which 'space' and 'time' are intrinsically linked. The motion of an object through space inevitably impacts the way in which it experiences time.In 1915, Einstein published general relativity, which explains gravity as the curvature of spacetime. Matter and energy (including light) follow geodesics. Einstein's theory of gravity predicts a dynamic universe.Chapter 3: The Expanding Universe\n[edit]Hawking describes how physicists and astronomers calculated the relative distance of stars from the Earth. Sir William Herschel confirmed the positions and distances of many stars in the night sky. In 1924, Edwin Hubble discovered a method to measure the distance using the brightness of Cepheid variable stars as viewed from Earth. The luminosity and distance of these stars are related by a simple mathematical formula. Using this, he showed that ours is not the only galaxy.In 1929, Hubble discovered that light from most galaxies was shifted to the red, and that the degree of redshift is directly proportional to distance. From this, he determined that the universe is expanding. This possibility had not been seriously considered. Einstein was so sure of a static universe that he added the cosmological constant to his equations. Many astronomers also tried to avoid the implications of general relativity, with one notable exception: the Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann.In 1922, Friedmann made two very simple assumptions: the universe is identical wherever we are, (homogeneity), and that it is identical in every direction that we look, (isotropy). It follows that the universe is non-static. Support was found when two physicists at Bell Labs, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, found unexpected microwave radiation coming from all parts of the sky.At around the same time, Robert H. Dicke and Jim Peebles were also working on microwave radiation. They argued that radiation from the early universe should be detectable as the cosmic microwave background. This was what Penzias and Wilson had found.In 1965, Roger Penrose used general relativity to prove that a collapsing star could result in a singularity. Hawking and Penrose proved together that the universe should have arisen from a singularity. Hawking later argued this need not be the case once quantum effects are taken into account.Chapter 4: The Uncertainty Principle\n[edit]Hawking begins by discussing nineteenth-century French mathematician Laplace's belief in scientific determinism, where scientific laws would be able to perfectly predict the future of the universe. A crack in classical physics appeared with the ultraviolet catastrophe: according to the calculations of British scientists Lord Rayleigh and James Jeans, a hot body should radiate an infinite amount of energy. In 1900, the ultraviolet catastrophe was averted by Max Planck, who proposed that energy must be absorbed or emitted in discrete packets called quanta.Hawking discusses Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, according to which the speed and the position of a particle cannot be precisely known due to Planck's quantum hypothesis: increasing the accuracy in measuring its speed will decrease the certainty of its position and vice versa. This overturned Laplace's idea of a completely deterministic theory of the universe. Hawking describes the development by Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger and Paul Dirac of quantum mechanics, a theory which introduced an irreducible element of unpredictability into science, and despite Einstein's strong objections, has proven to be very successful in describing the universe at small scales.Hawking discusses how Heisenberg's uncertainty principle implies the wave–particle duality of light (and particles in general).He describes the phenomenon of interference, where multiple light waves interfere with each other to give rise to a single light wave with properties different from those of the component waves, as well as the interference within particles, exemplified by the two-slit experiment. Hawking writes that American scientist Richard Feynman's sum over histories is a useful way of visualize quantum behavior. Hawking explains that Einstein's general theory of relativity is a classical, non-quantum theory as it ignores the uncertainty principle and that it has to be reconciled with quantum theory in situations where gravity is very strong, as in a singularity.Chapter 5: Elementary Particles and Forces of Nature\n[edit]Hawking traces the history of investigation into the nature of matter: Aristotle's four elements, Democritus's indivisible atoms, John Dalton's idea of atoms combining to form molecules, J. J. Thomson's discovery of the electron, Ernest Rutherford's discovery of the atomic nucleus, James Chadwick's discovery of the neutron and finally Murray Gell-Mann's theorizing of quarks which constitute protons and neutrons (collectively called hadrons). Hawking discusses the six different \"flavors\" (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, and top) and three different \"colors\" of quarks (red, green, and blue). Later he discusses anti-quarks, which are outnumbered by quarks due to the expansion and cooling of the universe.Hawking introduces the spin of particles. Particles can be divided into two groups. Fermions, or matter particles, have a spin of 1/2. Fermions follow Wolfgang Pauli's exclusion principle: they cannot share the same quantum state (for example, two \"spin up\" protons cannot occupy the same location in space). Without this rule, atoms could not exist. Bosons, or the force-carrying particles, have a spin of 0, 1, or 2 and do not follow the exclusion principle.Gravity is thought to be carried by gravitons, massless particles with spin 2. The electromagnetic force is carried by photons. The weak nuclear force is responsible for radioactivity and is carried by W and Z bosons. The strong nuclear force, which binds quarks into hadrons and binds hadrons together into atomic nuclei, is carried by the gluon. Hawking writes that color confinement prevents the discovery of quarks and gluons on their own (except at extremely high temperature) as they remain confined within hadrons.Hawking writes that at extremely high temperature, the electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force behave as a single electroweak force, giving rise to the speculation that at even higher temperatures, the electroweak force and strong nuclear force would also behave as a single force. Theories which attempt to describe the behaviour of this \"combined\" force are called Grand Unified Theories, which may help us explain many of the mysteries of physics.Chapter 6: Black Holes\n[edit]Hawking discusses black holes, regions of spacetime where extremely strong gravity prevents everything, including light, from escaping them. The term black hole was coined by John Archibald Wheeler in 1969, although the idea is older. The Cambridge clergyman John Michell imagined stars so massive that light could not escape their gravitational pull. Hawking explains stellar evolution: how main sequence stars shine by fusing hydrogen into helium, staving off gravitational collapse. A collapsed star may form a white dwarf, supported by electron degeneracy, or a neutron star, supported by the exclusion principle. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar found that for a collapsed star of more than 1.4 solar masses, there would be nothing to halt complete gravitational collapse. He was dissuaded from this thinking by Arthur Eddington, though it later won him the Nobel Prize in Physics. The critical mass is known as the Chandrasekhar limit.He describes the event horizon, the black hole's boundary from which no particle can escape. He writes: \"One could well say of the event horizon what the poet Dante said of the entrance to Hell: 'All hope abandon, ye who enter here.'\"[7] Hawking discusses non-rotating black holes with spherical symmetry and rotating ones with axisymmetry. The discovery of quasars by Maarten Schmidt in 1963 and pulsars by Jocelyn Bell-Burnell in 1967 gave hope that black holes might be detected. Even though black holes (by definition) do not emit light, astronomers can observe them through their interactions with visible matter. A star falling into a black hole would be a powerful source of X-rays. Cygnus X-1, a powerful source of X-rays, was the earliest plausible candidate for a black hole. Hawking concludes by mentioning his 1974 bet with American physicist Kip Thorne. Hawking argued that Cygnus X-1 does not contain a black hole. Hawking conceded the bet as evidence for black holes proved overwhelming.Chapter 7: Black Holes Ain't So Black\n[edit]Hawking discusses an aspect of black holes' behavior that he discovered in the 1970s. According to earlier theories, black holes can only become larger because nothing which enters a black hole can come out. This was similar to entropy, a measure of disorder which, per the second law of thermodynamics, always increases. Hawking and his student Jacob Bekenstein suggested that the area of a black hole's event horizon is a measure of its entropy.But if a black hole has entropy, it must have a temperature, and must emit radiation. In 1974, Hawking published a new theory which argued that black holes can emit radiation. He imagined what might happen if a pair of virtual particles appeared near the edge of a black hole. Virtual particles briefly 'borrow' energy from the vacuum, then annihilate each other, returning the borrowed energy and ceasing to exist. However, at the edge of a black hole, one virtual particle might be trapped by the black hole while the other escapes. Thus, the particle takes energy from the black hole instead of from the vacuum, and escape from the black hole as Hawking radiation. According to Hawking, black holes must very slowly shrink over time and eventually \"evaporate\" because of this radiation.Chapter 8: The Origin and Fate of the Universe\n[edit]Hawking recalls a conference on cosmology at the Vatican, where he was given an audience with Pope John Paul II. The Pope said it was fine to study the early universe, but scientists should not study the Big Bang itself, as that was the moment of Creation and the work of God. Hawking writes: \"I was glad then that he did not know the subject of the talk I had just given at the conference -- the possibility that space-time was finite but had no boundary, which means that it had no beginning, no moment of Creation. I had no desire to share the fate of Galileo, with whom I feel a strong sense of identity, partly because of the coincidence of having been born exactly 300 years after his death!\"[8]At the Big Bang, the universe had an extremely high temperature, which prevented the formation of complex structures like stars, or even very simple ones like atoms. George Gamow predicted that radiation from the Big Bang should still fill the present universe. This was the cosmic microwave background discovered by Penzias and Wilson. The Big Bang created hydrogen and helium, and heavier elements were forged in stars.The Big Bang model was supported by the redshift of galaxies, the cosmic microwave background and the relative abundance of hydrogen and helium. But mysteries remained: Why is the universe isotropic? Why is the cosmic microwave background so homogenous? Widely separated parts of the universe have the same temperature, but there would not have been time for these regions to have come into contact. Alan Guth's model of cosmic Inflation provided an answer to this horizon problem. Inflation explains other characteristics of the universe that had previously greatly confused researchers. After inflation, the universe continued to expand at a slower pace. It became much colder, eventually allowing for the formation of such stars.Hawking discusses how the universe might have appeared if it had expanded slower or faster than it actually has. If the universe expanded too slowly, it would collapse, and there would not be enough time for life to form. If the universe expanded too quickly, it would have become almost empty. He discusses the anthropic principle, which states that the universe has laws of physics that allow for the evolution of life because, if it didn't, we wouldn't be here. Hawking suggests the no boundary proposal: that the universe is finite but has no beginning in imaginary time. It might merely exist.Chapter 9: The Arrow of Time\n[edit]Hawking discusses three \"arrows of time\". The first is the thermodynamic arrow of time: the direction in which entropy increases. This is given as the explanation for why we never see the broken pieces of a cup gather themselves together to form a whole cup. The second is the psychological arrow of time, whereby our subjective sense of time seems to flow in one direction, which is why we remember the past and not the future. The third is the cosmological arrow of time: the direction in which the universe is expanding rather than contracting. Hawking claims that the psychological arrow is intertwined with the thermodynamic arrow. According to Hawking, during a contraction phase of the universe, the thermodynamic and cosmological arrows of time would not agree.Hawking then claims that the \"no boundary proposal\" for the universe implies that the universe will expand for some time before contracting back again. He goes on to argue that the no boundary proposal is what drives entropy and that it predicts the existence of a well-defined thermodynamic arrow of time if and only if the universe is expanding, as it implies that the universe must have started in a smooth and ordered state that must grow toward disorder as time advances. He argues that, because of the no boundary proposal, a contracting universe would not have a well-defined thermodynamic arrow and therefore only a universe that is in an expansion phase can support intelligent life. Using the weak anthropic principle, Hawking goes on to argue that the thermodynamic arrow must agree with the cosmological arrow in order for either to be observed by intelligent life. This, in Hawking's view, is why humans experience these three arrows of time going in the same direction.Chapter 10: Wormholes and Time Travel\n[edit]Hawking discusses whether time travel is possible. He shows how physicists have attempted to devise possible methods by humans with advanced technology may be able to travel faster than the speed of light, or travel backwards in time. Kurt Gödel presented Einstein with a solution to general relativity that allowed for time travel in a rotating universe. Einstein–Rosen bridges were proposed early in the history of the theory. These wormholes would appear identical to black holes from the outside, but matter which entered would be relocated to a different location in spacetime, potentially in a distant region of space, or even backwards in time. However, later research demonstrated that such a wormhole would not allow any material to pass through before turning back into a regular black hole. The only way that a wormhole could theoretically remain open, and thus allow faster-than-light travel or time travel, would require the existence of exotic matter with negative energy density, which violates the energy conditions of general relativity. As such, almost all physicists agree that faster-than-light travel and travel backwards in time are not possible.Chapter 11: The Unification of Physics\n[edit]Quantum mechanics and general relativity describe the universe with astounding accuracy within their own domains of applicability (atomic and cosmic scales, respectively). However, these two theories run into problems when combined. For example, the uncertainty principle is incompatible with Einstein's theory. This contradiction has led physicists to search for a theory of quantum gravity.Hawking is cautiously optimistic that such a unified theory of the universe may be found soon, in spite of significant challenges. At the time the book was written, superstring theory had emerged as the most popular theory of quantum gravity, but this theory and related string theories were still incomplete and had not yielded testable predictions (this remains the case as of 2021). String theory proposes that particles behave like one-dimensional \"strings\", rather than as dimensionless particles. These strings \"vibrate\" in many dimensions. Superstring theory requires a total of 10 dimensions. The nature of the six \"hyperspace\" dimensions required by superstring theory are difficult if not impossible to study.Hawking thus proposes three possibilities: 1) there exists a complete unified theory that we will eventually find; 2) the overlapping characteristics of different landscapes will allow us to gradually explain physics more accurately with time and 3) there is no ultimate theory. The third possibility has been sidestepped by acknowledging the limits set by the uncertainty principle. The second possibility describes what has been happening in physical sciences so far, with increasingly accurate partial theories.Hawking believes that such refinement has a limit and that by studying the very early stages of the universe in a laboratory setting, a complete theory of Quantum Gravity will be found in the 21st century allowing physicists to solve many of the currently unsolved problems in physics.Conclusion\n[edit]Hawking summarises the efforts made by humans through their history to understand the universe and their place in it: starting from the belief in anthropomorphic spirits controlling nature, followed by the recognition of regular patterns in nature, and finally with the understanding of the inner workings of the universe. He recalls Laplace's suggestion that the universe's structure and evolution could eventually be precisely explained by a set of laws whose origin is left in God's domain. However, Hawking states that the uncertainty principle introduced by quantum theory has set limits on knowledge.Hawking comments that historically, the study of cosmology has been primarily motivated by a search for philosophical and religious insights, for instance, to better understand the nature of God, or even whether God exists at all. However, for Hawking, most scientists today who work on these theories approach them with mathematical calculation and empirical observation, rather than asking such philosophical questions. In his mind, the increasingly technical nature of these theories have caused modern cosmology to become increasingly divorced from philosophy. Hawking nonetheless expresses hope that one day everybody would understand the true origin and nature of the universe. \"That would be the ultimate triumph of human reason—for then we know would know the mind of God\".[9]The introduction was removed after the first edition, as it was copyrighted by Sagan, rather than by Hawking or the publisher, and the publisher did not have the right to reprint it in perpetuity. Hawking wrote his own introduction for later editions.Main article: A Brief History of Time (film)In 1991, Errol Morris directed a documentary film about Hawking; although they share a title, the film is a biographical study of Hawking, and not a filmed version of the book.\"Stephen Hawking's Pocket Universe: A Brief History of Time Revisited\" is based on the book. The app was developed by Preloaded for Transworld publishers, a division of the Penguin Random House group.The app was produced in 2016. It was designed by Ben Courtney and produced by Jemma Harris and is available on iOS only.The Metropolitan Opera commissioned an opera to premiere in the 2015–2016 season based on Hawking's book. It was to be composed by Osvaldo Golijov with a libretto by Alberto Manguel in a production by Robert Lepage.[12] The planned opera was changed to be about a different subject and eventually canceled completely.[13]A Brief History of Time was included on Time magazine's list of the 100 best nonfiction books since the magazine's founding.

{"title":"The Wind in the Willows","author":"Kenneth Grahame","published":1908,"fiction":true,"plot":"With the arrival of spring and fine weather outside, the good-natured Mole loses patience with spring cleaning, exclaiming, \"Hang spring cleaning!\" He leaves behind his underground home and comes up at the bank of the river, which he has never seen before. Here he meets Rat, a water vole, who takes Mole for a ride in his rowing boat. They get along well and spend many more days boating, with \"Ratty\" teaching Mole the ways of the river, with the two friends living together in Ratty's riverside home.One summer day, Rat and Mole disembark near the grand Toad Hall and pay a visit to Toad. Toad is rich, jovial, friendly, and kindhearted, but sometimes arrogant and rash; he regularly becomes obsessed with current fads, only to abandon them abruptly. His current craze is his horse-drawn caravan. When a passing car scares his horse and causes the caravan to overturn into a ditch, Toad's craze for caravan travel is immediately replaced by an obsession with motorcars.Mole goes to the Wild Wood on a snowy winter's day, hoping to meet the elusive but virtuous and wise Badger. He gets lost in the woods, succumbs to fright, and hides among the sheltering roots of a tree. Rat finds him as snow begins to fall in earnest. Attempting to find their way home, Mole barks his shin on the boot scraper on Badger's doorstep. Badger welcomes Rat and Mole to his large, cosy underground home, providing them with hot food, dry clothes, and reassuring conversation. Badger learns from his visitors that Toad has crashed seven cars, has been in hospital three times, and has spent a fortune on fines.With the arrival of spring, the three of them put Toad under house arrest with themselves as the guards, but Toad pretends to be sick and tricks Ratty to leave so he can escape. Badger and Mole continue to live in Toad Hall in the hope that Toad may return. Toad orders lunch at The Red Lion Inn and then sees a motorcar pull into the courtyard. Taking the car, he drives it recklessly, is caught by the police, and is sent to prison for 20 years (most of which is for \"gross impertinence\" to his captors).In prison, Toad gains the sympathy of the gaoler's daughter, who helps him to escape disguised as a washerwoman. After a long series of misadventures, he returns to the hole of the Water Rat. Rat hauls Toad inside and informs him that Toad Hall has been taken over by weasels, stoats, and ferrets from the Wild Wood, who have driven out Mole and Badger. Armed to the teeth, Badger, Rat, Mole, and Toad enter through the tunnel and pounce upon the unsuspecting Wild-Wooders who are holding a celebratory party. Having driven away the intruders, Toad holds a banquet to mark his return, during which he behaves both quietly and humbly. He makes up for his earlier excesses by seeking out and compensating those he has wronged, and the four friends live happily ever after.In addition to the main narrative, the book contains several independent short stories featuring Rat and Mole, such as an encounter with the wild god Pan while searching for Otter's son Portly, and Ratty's meeting with a Sea Rat. These appear for the most part between the chapters chronicling Toad's adventures, and they are often omitted from adaptations of the story, as well as some abridged versions.The original publication of the book was plain text, with a frontispiece illustrated by Graham Robertson, but many illustrated, comic, and annotated versions have been published over the years. Notable illustrators include Paul Bransom (1913), Nancy Barnhart (1922), Wyndham Payne (1927), Ernest H. Shepard (1931), Arthur Rackham (1940), Richard Cuffari (1966), Tasha Tudor (1966), Michael Hague (1980), Scott McKowen (2005), and Robert Ingpen (2007).A number of publishers rejected the manuscript. It was published in the UK by Methuen and Co., and later in the US by Scribner. The critics, who were hoping for a third volume in the style of Grahame's earlier works, The Golden Age and Dream Days, generally gave negative reviews.[4] The public loved it, however, and within a few years it sold in such numbers that many reprints were required, with 100 editions reached in Britain alone by 1951.[11] In 1909, then US President Theodore Roosevelt wrote to Grahame to tell that he had \"read it and reread it, and have come to accept the characters as old friends\".[12]In The Enchanted Places, Christopher Robin Milne wrote of The Wind in the Willows:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 32px}.mw-parser-output .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;margin-top:0}@media(min-width:500px){.mw-parser-output .templatequotecite{padding-left:1.6em}}Stage\n[edit]Theatrical films\n[edit]Television\n[edit]Unproduced\n[edit]Web series\n[edit]Radio\n[edit]The BBC has broadcast a number of radio productions of the story.

A 29 hectare extension to the nature reserve at Moor Copse, near Tidmarsh Berkshire, was acquired in January 2007 by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust.[34]Peter Ackroyd, in his book Thames: Sacred River, asserts that \"Quarry Wood, bordering on the river [Thames] at Cookham Dean, is the original of [the] 'Wild Wood'...\"[35]Music\n[edit]Adventure rides\n[edit]Other\n[edit]^ \"Classic Willows story turns 100\".

{"title":"Totto-Chan: The Little Girl at the Window","author":"Tetsuko Kuroyanagi","published":1981,"fiction":true,"plot":"The book begins with Totto-chan's mother coming to know of her daughter's expulsion from public school. Her mother realizes that Totto-chan needs a school where more freedom of expression is permitted. Thus, she takes Totto-chan to meet the headmaster of the new school, Mr. Kobayashi, where the two establish a friendly teacher-student relationship.The book describes the friends Totto-chan makes, the lessons she learns, and the vibrant atmosphere she enjoys at Tomoe Gakuen. Mr. Kobayashi introduces new activities to interest the pupils. Mr. Kobayashi understands children and strives to develop their minds and bodies. He is concerned for the physically disabled and emphasizes how all children are remarkable. \"Totto-chan\" becomes best friends with a Christian boy who has polio. Another classmate was raised in America and cannot speak Japanese; the headmaster tells the children to learn English from him, despite governmental restraints against using the \"enemy's\" language. The epilogue explains how Headmaster Kobayashi had good connections with leaders in government.In this school, the children lead happy lives, unaware of the things going on in the world. World War II has started, yet no signs of it are seen. There are hints of something awry when \"Totto-chan\" cannot buy caramel candies from the vending machine on her way to school, and it becomes harder for her mother to meet the requirements for a balanced lunch. In another scene, a boy is bawling his eyes out at being removed from the school by his parents. Headmaster Kobayashi helplessly lets the student vent, with tears forming in his own eyes.One day, the school is bombed, and is never rebuilt, even though the headmaster claims that he is looking forward to building an even better school the next time round. This ends Totto-chan's years as a pupil at Tomoe Gakuen.Starting in 1983, it has been used as a textbook for third-year Japanese elementary students,[4] and at least one American school has used material from it (1993).[9]In Aichi Prefecture the book was banned from school libraries for some time because it was written by a television personality, which was seen as a demeaning occupation. Other books banned from Aichi schools in 1981 include books about liberalism and feminism, and Saburō Ienaga's history textbooks which provided details on Japanese war crimes.[10]Kuroyanagi founded the Totto-chan Foundation, which professionally trains deaf actors to bring live theater to the deaf community.In 1999, Kuroyanagi published her book Totto-Chan's Children: A Goodwill Journey to the Children of the World, about her travels around the world on her humanitarian mission as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.[1]An orchestral interpretation of the work was written by Japanese composer Akihiro Komori, which was released as a record.[citation needed]An anime film adaptation was announced on March 20, 2023. It was produced by Shin-Ei Animation and directed by Shinnosuke Yakuwa, with Yakuwa and Yosuke Suzuki writing the scripts, Shizue Kaneko designing the characters, and Yuji Nomi composing the soundtrack. It was released on December 8, 2023.[11][12]^ a b c d Walker, James. \"BIG IN JAPAN: Tetsuko Kuroyanagi\". metropolis.co.jp. Archived from the original on 2008-06-12.

{"title":"The Celestine Prophecy: An Adventure","author":"James Redfield","published":1993,"fiction":true,"plot":"The book discusses various psychological and spiritual ideas that are rooted in many ancient Eastern traditions, such as how opening to new possibilities can help an individual establish a connection with the divine. The main character undertakes a journey to find and understand a series of nine spiritual insights in an ancient manuscript in Peru. The book is a first-person narrative of spiritual awakening. The narrator is in a transitional period of his life and begins to notice instances of synchronicity, which is the belief that coincidences have a meaning personal to those who experience them.The story opens with the male narrator becoming reacquainted with an old female friend, who tells him about the insights contained in a manuscript dating to 600 BC, which has been only recently translated. After this encounter leaves him curious, he decides to go to Peru. On the airplane, he meets a historian who also happens to be interested in the manuscript.The historian explains how the world is currently undergoing an enormous shift in consciousness, elaborating on how things had been generally understood (until now) to be: 1) In the beginning, people believed the world to be governed by the forces of divinity; everything could be explained as an act of a god or gods, 2) With increasing knowledge of the world, brought about by scientific inquiry, people turned to the men and women of science for an explanation of life and their world, and 3) Since the problem of how to find meaning in the world could not be solved by science, people chose to instead focus on efforts to improve their lives materially, subduing and plundering the earth for its natural resources, with a hyper-emphasis on controlling economic conditions and market fluctuations. What was now occurring, explained the historian, was that the baseness of our current conditions had begun to infect our souls as well. We had become restless and desperate, primed for another fundamental shift in consciousness so as to bring about the creation of a new, better world.He also discovers that powerful figures within the Peruvian government and the Catholic Church are opposed to the dissemination of the material found in the manuscript. This is dramatically illustrated when the police try to arrest and then shoot the historian after his arrival. Threats to his life forced the narrator to live nomadically, moving from town to town in search of kind-hearted people who would offer lodging in exchange for more information about the manuscript and its message.While evading the Church and Peruvian government, the narrator finds time to read from the prized manuscript that offers 'Insights' as a sequence of passages. During pursuit, the narrator experiences real-world lessons that prepare him for each Insight in advance. In the end, he returns to the United States after learning the first nine Insights, and promises to reveal a 'Tenth Insight' to his audience in a short time. 'Insights' as such, are never made explicit to the reader, but are instead paraphrased through action; made into a sequence of parables that drive the storyline. Sourcing transcription is made impossible by the narrator, claiming, \"it must be the way it is for sake of brevity\"; adding that even a partial translation of the Ninth 'Insight' is a lengthy twenty pages, typewritten.In the novel, the Celestine Temple in the ruins of an ancient civilization in Peru was where the manuscript was buried. After it was found, the Incas re-inhabited the abandoned cities. At some point, the ancients reached an \"energy vibration level\" threshold that allowed them to cross over into a reality of pure spirituality.Redfield has acknowledged the work of Dr. Eric Berne, the developer of transactional analysis, and his 1964 bestseller Games People Play, as major influences on his work.[citation needed]Redfield originally self-published The Celestine Prophecy, selling 100,000 copies out of the trunk of his car before Warner Books agreed to publish it.[1]Christopher Franke, former member of Tangerine Dream, adapted the book into a music album in 1996.[2]As of May 2005, the book had sold over 5 million copies worldwide,[3] with translations into 34 languages.A film adaptation was released in 2006.Redfield expanded the book's concept into a series, which he completed in three sequels:The book was generally well received by readers and spent 165 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list.[5]The Celestine Prophecy has also received some criticism, mostly from the literary community, who point out that the plot of the story is not well developed and serves only as a delivery tool for the author's ideas about spirituality.[citation needed] James Redfield has admitted that, even though he considers the book to be a novel, his intention was to write a parable,[6] a story meant to illustrate a point or teach a lesson.^ \"Self publishing: Get published now\".

{"title":"The Fault in Our Stars","author":"John Green","published":2012,"fiction":true,"plot":"Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16-year-old with thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs, attends a cancer patient support group at her mother's behest. At one meeting, Hazel meets a 17-year-old boy currently in remission named Augustus Waters, whose osteosarcoma caused him to lose his right leg. Augustus is at the meeting to support Isaac, his friend who has eye cancer. Hazel and Augustus strike a bond immediately and agree to read each other's favorite novels. Augustus gives Hazel The Price of Dawn, and Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels Hazel's own experience. After Augustus finishes reading her book, he is frustrated upon learning that the novel ends abruptly without a conclusion, as if Anna had died suddenly. Hazel explains the novel's author, Peter van Houten, retreated to Amsterdam following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.A week later, Augustus reveals to Hazel that he has tracked down Van Houten's assistant, Lidewij, and, through her, has managed to start an e-mail correspondence with Van Houten. The two write to Van Houten with questions regarding the novel's ending; he eventually replies, explaining that he can only answer Hazel's questions in person. At a picnic, Augustus surprises Hazel with tickets to Amsterdam to meet Van Houten, acquired through the story's version of the Make-A-Wish Foundation, \"The Genie Foundation\".Upon meeting Van Houten, Hazel and Augustus are shocked to discover that he is a mean-spirited alcoholic. Horrified by Van Houten's hostile behavior towards the teenagers, Lidewij confesses to having arranged the meeting on his behalf. Lidewij resigns as Van Houten's assistant and takes Hazel and Augustus to the Anne Frank House, where Augustus and Hazel share their first kiss. Later that night Hazel and Augustus lose their virginity to one another in Augustus's hotel room, confessing their love for each other.The next day, Augustus reveals that his cancer has returned. Upon their return to Indianapolis, Augustus's health continues to deteriorate, resulting in him staying in the ICU for a few days. Fearing his death, Augustus invites Isaac and Hazel to his pre-funeral, where they give eulogies. Augustus dies soon after, leaving Hazel heartbroken. Van Houten shows up at Augustus's funeral to apologize to Hazel.Hazel learns that Augustus had written an obituary for her, and reads it after Lidewij discovers it amidst Van Houten's letters. It states that getting hurt in this world is unavoidable, but we do get to choose whom we allow to hurt us, and that he is happy with his choice, and hopes she likes hers too. The book closes with Hazel stating that she is happy with her choice.Other characters include:After graduating from Kenyon College, Green spent about five months working as a student chaplain at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.[4] He has cited this experience as inspiration for his story:[5]This young friend who died was Esther Earl, who is named in the book's dedication.[6]Green worked on The Fault in our Stars in 2011, while staying as a writer in residence in Amsterdam at the invitation of the Dutch Foundation for Literature.[7]Two books served as an inspiration for the fictional book An Imperial Affliction: The Blood of the Lamb by Peter De Vries and Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace.[8]On December 21, 2011, Barnes & Noble accidentally shipped 1,500 copies of The Fault in Our Stars before the release date to people who had pre-ordered the book. Green released a statement saying, \"Mistakes happen. The people who made this error were not bad or incompetent people, and they were not acting maliciously. We all make mistakes, and it is not my wish to see Barnes and Noble or any of their employees vilified.\"[9] Many people who received the book pledged not to read it until its release date, January 10, 2012, or discuss it until the next day, January 11, as per a request of Green's not to spoil it for other readers. Most kept to this promise, leaving the experience untarnished for those who got the book on the intended release date.[10]The book rose to #84 on the Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble bestseller lists in June 2011 shortly after its title was announced.[11] Green promised that every pre-order would be hand-signed by him, requiring him to sign every copy of the first printing. He proposed that the general public vote on the color Sharpie he would use to sign the books, resulting in him signing the 150,000 books with a variety of Sharpie colors, each in proportion to the number of votes received for that color.[12] However, some people who ordered from international booksellers received unsigned copies because those bookstores, including Amazon UK, underestimated how many books they needed and ordered more after the signing was complete, but Green agreed to fix this problem, telling people with unsigned pre-orders to email him so they could be sent a signed bookplate.[13] Many fans submitted their book cover designs to various outlets including Tumblr and Twitter, tagging Green in these posts so he could see them. The sizeable number of posts received prompted Green's publisher Penguin to seek a fan-designed cover for a reprint of one of Green's other books, An Abundance of Katherines.[14]The Fault in Our Stars debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Chapter Books[15] and remained in that spot for seven consecutive weeks.[16] A Hebrew edition of The Fault in Our Stars was published in Israel in August 2012 and more editions of the novel are forthcoming[as of?] in Dutch, German, Spanish, French, Swedish, Danish, Icelandic, Chinese, Persian and Portuguese. The Fault in Our Stars has also gained places on several bestseller lists. It was No. 1 on The Wall Street Journal bestseller list, No. 1 on the Indiebound bestseller list, and No. 9 on The Bookseller bestseller list. The novel was also The New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice.[17] As of January 2013, there are nearly 1 million copies of the novel in print.[18] In December 2012, it was announced that a special edition with a silver cover and an expanded Q&A, dubbed the 'Exclusive Collector's Edition', would be available from Barnes & Noble. All or at least most of the copies first available for purchase of this edition of the book contained a printing error wherein several pages of the first chapter were replaced with pages from the Q&A section at the back of the book.[19] As of October 2017, the book has sold 23 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books of all time.[20]The New York Times' review of the book called it \"a blend of melancholy, sweet, philosophical and funny\" and said that it \"stays the course of tragic realism\", while noting that the book's unpleasant plot details \"do nothing to diminish the romance; in Green's hands, they only make it more moving\".[21]NPR's Rachel Syme noted that \"[Green's] voice is so compulsively readable that it defies categorization\", saying that the \"elegantly plotted\" book \"may be his best\".[22]Time called The Fault in Our Stars \"damn near genius\".[23]Entertainment Weekly wrote, \"[Augustus and Hazel's] love story is as real as it is doomed, and the gut-busting laughs that come early in the novel make the luminous final pages all the more heartbreaking\", and gave the novel an overall A− grade.[24] The Manila Bulletin says that the book is \"a collection of maudlin scenes and trite observations about the fragility of life and the wisdom of dying. And while it does talk about those things and more, the treatment of it is far from being maudlin or trite.\"[25] The Manila Bulletin also added that \"Just two paragraphs into the work, and he immediately wallops the readers with such an insightful observation delivered in such an unsentimental way that its hard not to shake your head in admiration.\"[25] The Manila Bulletin stated that The Fault in Our Stars was a triumph for John Green.[25]USA Today called it an \"elegiac comedy\".[26] They gave the book a rating of four out of four stars.[26]The School Library Journal stated that it was \"a strong choice for young adult collections\".[27]The Fault in Our Stars received a starred review from Kirkus Reviews, who described it as \"a smartly crafted intellectual explosion of a romance\".[28]Several well-known authors have contributed their own positive reviews for the book. Jodi Picoult, author of My Sister's Keeper, calls The Fault in Our Stars \"an electric portrait of young people who learn to live life with one foot in the grave\". She goes on to say that the novel is \"filled with staccato bursts of humor and tragedy\". Bestselling author of The Book Thief, Markus Zusak, describes it as \"a novel of life and death and the people caught in between\" and \"John Green at his best\". Pertaining to Green's writing throughout the book, E. Lockhart, author of The Boyfriend List, says: \"He makes me laugh and gasp at the beauty of a sentence or the twist of a tale. He is one of the best writers alive and I am seething with envy of his talent.\"[29]Time named The Fault in Our Stars as the No. 1 fiction book of 2012.[30]Kirkus Reviews listed it among the top 100 children's books of 2012.[31] It also made USA Today's list of the top 10 books of 2012.[32] In 2013, the Edmonton Journal named the book one of their \"favourite books of the year\".[33]One notable unfavorable opinion appeared in the Daily Mail: the entire genre, as well as the genre of young-adult novels dealing with suicide and self-harm, was criticized as being \"distasteful\" and inappropriate for their target audience of teens.[34]The Guardian criticized the piece, pointing out in particular that The Fault in Our Stars was chosen by The Guardian as that month's \"teen book club choice\" because \"it's a gripping read, featuring two compelling characters, that deals sensitively and even humorously with a difficult situation without descending into mawkishness\". In general, The Guardian faulted the Daily Mail for suggesting that the issues of illness, depression, and sexuality are inappropriate precisely \"in the one place where difficult subjects have traditionally been most sensitively explored for teens: fiction written specifically for them\".[34] For his part, in an interview for The Guardian, John Green said: \"The thing that bothered me about The Daily Mail piece was that it was a bit condescending to teenagers. I'm tired of adults telling teenagers that they aren't smart, that they can't read critically, that they aren't thoughtful, and I feel like that article made those arguments.\"[35]English-language film\n[edit]Main article: The Fault in Our Stars (film)In January 2012, Fox 2000 Pictures optioned the movie rights to adapt the novel into a feature film.[1]Scott Neustadter, Michael H. Weber and Josh Boone wrote the adapted screenplay, with Josh Boone also serving as director.[36]Shailene Woodley stars as Hazel, while Ansel Elgort plays Augustus.[37]Principal photography took place between August and October 2013, with Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, doubling for the novel's setting of Indianapolis, and included some location shooting in Amsterdam.[36] The film was released on June 6, 2014, in the United States,[38] receiving positive reviews and grossing over $307 million worldwide against its budget of $12 million.[39][40]Hindi-language film\n[edit]Main article: Dil BecharaIn August 2014, India's Fox Star Studios announced it would adapt the novel into an Indian Hindi-language film, with the working title of Kizie Aur Manny. Producer Karan Johar was supposed to produce the film but eventually backed out.[41] Filming began in July 2018, in Jamshedpur,[42] with first-time director Mukesh Chhabra guiding lead actor Sushant Singh Rajput (in his final film role[43]) and lead actress Sanjana Sanghi (in her film debut).[2] This adaptation ages up the characters and changes the main setting to India. The title of the movie was later changed to Dil Bechara (\"The Helpless Heart\") and is named after one of the original songs written for the movie that the director felt summed up the message of the film. Music composer A. R. Rahman has composed the background music and songs of the movie.[44]The film was scheduled to be released on May 8, 2020, after having been initially scheduled in November 2019, but was later postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India. It was released on July 24, 2020, on Disney+ Hotstar and was met with mainly positive reviews.[2]Stage play\n[edit]In 2017, Green authorized an amateur stage play adaptation of the book. The play was written by theatre director Tobin Strader of Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School in Indianapolis and four students at the high school. It was performed in 2019.[45]^ a b Deahl, Rachel (January 31, 2012). \"Fox Options John Green's 'Fault in Our Stars'\". Publishers Weekly. Archived from the original on December 12, 2018.

{"title":"The Girl on the Train","author":"Paula Hawkins","published":2015,"fiction":true,"plot":"Rachel Watson is a 33-year-old woman with behavioural issues related to her alcoholism. Her drinking has led to the end of her marriage to Tom, who left her for another woman. It has also caused her to lose her job; she frequently binges and has blackouts. Tom has since re-married to Anna Boyd and has a daughter with her, Evie – a situation that fuels Rachel's self-destructive tendencies. Though currently unemployed, Rachel still follows her old routine of taking the train to and from London every day, one at 8:04 in the morning and the other at 5:56 in the evening. This routine is one of her few excuses to leave her apartment, and prevents her roommate, Cathy, from discovering that she is unemployed. The train passes Rachel's old home on Blenheim Road, where Tom, Anna, and Evie now live. From the train, Rachel also watches a couple who live a few houses away from Tom. She idealizes their life (christening them \"Jason\" and \"Jess\"), and fantasizes about being friends with them. However, \"Jess\", whose real name is Megan Hipwell, has a troubled past and a far from perfect life. She has had several lovers, including her therapist, Dr. Kamal Abdic.One day, from the train, Rachel witnesses Megan passionately embracing another man. The next day, after heavy drinking, Rachel awakens to find herself bloody and injured, with no memories of the night before. She learns that Megan is missing, and is questioned by the police after Anna reports having seen her drunkenly staggering around the night of Megan's disappearance. Rachel tells the police she thinks Megan was having an affair. She then contacts Megan's husband, Scott (\"Jason\"), leading him to believe that she and Megan were friends. Rachel learns that the man she saw kissing Megan was Kamal.Rachel contacts Kamal, lying about her identity to get close to him and learn more about him. She makes a therapy appointment with him to see if he can help her recall the events that happened during her blackout that night. Rachel begins to gain insight into her life by speaking with him, inadvertently benefiting from the therapy. Her connections to Scott and Kamal, though built on lies, make her feel more important. She manages to not drink for days at a time, but always relapses. Meanwhile, she continues to call, visit, and harass Tom. Megan's body is found; she is revealed to have been pregnant, and her unborn child was fathered by neither Scott nor Kamal. As Scott discovers Rachel's lies and lashes out at her, her memories become clearer. Rachel remembers seeing Megan get into Tom's car. Anna discovers that Tom and Megan were having an affair.Rachel begins trusting her own memories more, and realises that many of the incidents Tom said she caused while drunk never really happened. He had been gaslighting her for years, making her question her sanity. Armed with this realisation, and the suspicion that he might have killed Megan, Rachel warns Anna. When Anna confronts him, Tom confesses to murdering Megan after she threatened to reveal the affair. Anna is cowed, fearing for her daughter's safety. Tom tries to beat and intimidate Rachel into keeping silent, but she defies him and fights back. Rachel stabs Tom with a corkscrew; Anna helps Rachel make sure that he dies from the wound. When the police arrive, Rachel and Anna support each other by corroborating their stories to explain their actions as self-defence. After this, Rachel decides to quit drinking and move on with her life.By early March, less than two months after its release, the novel had sold over one million copies,[9] and an additional half million by April.[10] It occupied the #1 spot of the UK hardback book chart for 20 weeks, breaking the record for the longest any book had held the top spot.[11] By 2021, it had sold an estimated 23 million copies worldwide.[12]Kirkus Reviews gave the novel a starred review, writing that: \"even the most astute readers will be in for a shock as Hawkins slowly unspools the facts, exposing the harsh realities of love and obsession's inescapable links to violence.\" Subsequently, the novel was honoured by Kirkus Reviews as one of the best novels of 2015. The book also won the 2015 Goodreads Choice Award in the category Mystery & Thriller.[13]In a less positive review for The New York Times, Jean Hanff Korelitz questioned the novel's narrative structure and criticised the protagonist for behaving \"illogically, self-destructively, and narcissistically.\"[14]The Girl on the Train has been compared to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, as both novels employ unreliable narrators and deal with suburban life.[1] Paula Hawkins has dismissed these comparisons, however, saying in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter: \"Amy Dunne is a psychopath, an incredibly controlling and manipulative, smart, cunning woman. [Rachel is] just a mess who can't do anything right.\"[15]The foreign rights have been sold in 34 countries, and the book has been translated into many languages, including:In addition, there are two translations in Iran, a country which under sanctions does not recognise other countries' copyright agreements: one by Nilufar Amnzadeh and another by Mahbubeh Musavi.[29]American adaptation\n[edit]Main article: The Girl on the Train (2016 film)The film rights for the novel were acquired in March 2014 by DreamWorks Pictures and Marc Platt Productions, with Jared Leboff (a producer at Marc Platt) set to produce.[30]Tate Taylor, who directed The Help (2011), was announced as the director of this film in May 2015, with Erin Cressida Wilson as scriptwriter.[31] In June 2015, British actress Emily Blunt was in talks to portray Rachel.[32] Author Hawkins said in July 2015 that the film's setting would be moved from the UK to the US.[33] The film began production in the New York City area in October 2015.[34] The film was released on 7 October 2016.[35] It remains mostly faithful to events in the book; the only distinct difference is that Rachel realises the truth about Tom's accusations of her behaviour except that she does it through a chance meeting with the wife of Tom's former manager (instead of her own efforts); the wife reveals that Tom was actually fired from his job because of his numerous affairs at the office, rather than Rachel's having a violent breakdown at a party. (In reality, Rachel simply drank too much and passed out in a guest room until Tom made her leave.)Indian adaptation\n[edit]Main article: The Girl on the Train (2021 film)On 24 April 2019 it was announced an Indian adaptation of the book was in the works, starring Parineeti Chopra.[36] The film was directed by Ribhu Dasgupta and produced under the banner of Reliance Entertainment. Principal photography began in early August 2019 in London.[37] Unlike the 2016 American adaptation, the Indian adaptation retained the book's original UK setting, but changed the majority of the character to Non-Resident Indians. The film's original release date of 8 May 2020 was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[38] The film was eventually released on 26 February 2021 on Netflix.[39]A stage adaptation of the novel by Rachel Wagstaff and Duncan Abel made its world premiere in The Courtyard Theatre at the West Yorkshire Playhouse from 12 May to 9 June 2018. It stars Jill Halfpenny as Rachel Watson and is directed by Joe Murphy.[40]In 2022 it is presented by the Court Theater in Christchurch, New Zealand.[41]In 2024, the play had its Canadian premiere at Vertigo Theatre in Calgary, Alberta.[42]^ a b Maslin, Janet (4 January 2015). \"Another Girl Gone in a Tale of Betrayal – 'The Girl on the Train' by Paula Hawkins\".

{"title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin","author":"Harriet Beecher Stowe","published":1852,"fiction":true,"plot":"Eliza escapes with her son; Tom sold \"down the river\"The book opens with a Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby facing the loss of his farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife Emily Shelby believe that they have a benevolent relationship with their slaves, Shelby decides to raise the needed funds by selling two of them—Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby's maid Eliza—to Mr. Haley, a coarse slave trader. Emily Shelby is averse to this idea because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to see Tom go because he sees the man as his friend and mentor.When Eliza overhears Mr. and Mrs. Shelby discussing plans to sell Tom and Harry, Eliza determines to run away with her son. The novel states that Eliza made this decision because she fears losing her only surviving child (she had already miscarried two children). Eliza departs that night, leaving a note of apology to her mistress. She later makes a dangerous crossing over the ice of the Ohio River to escape her pursuers.As Tom is sold, Mr. Haley takes him to a riverboat on the Mississippi River and from there Tom is to be transported to a slave market. While on board, Tom meets Eva, an angelic little white girl. They quickly become friends. Eva falls into the river and Tom dives into the river to save her life. Being grateful to Tom, Eva's father Augustine St. Clare buys him from Haley and takes him with the family to their home in New Orleans. Tom and Eva begin to relate to one another because of the deep Christian faith they both share.Eliza's family hunted; Tom's life with St. ClareDuring Eliza's escape, she meets up with her husband George Harris, who had run away previously. They decide to attempt to reach Canada but are tracked by Tom Loker, a slave hunter hired by Mr. Haley. Eventually Loker and his men trap Eliza and her family, causing George to shoot him in the side. Worried that Loker may die, Eliza convinces George to bring the slave hunter to a nearby Quaker settlement for medical treatment.Back in New Orleans, St. Clare debates slavery with his Northern cousin Ophelia who, while opposing slavery, is prejudiced against black people. St. Clare, however, believes he is not biased, even though he is a slave owner. In an attempt to show Ophelia that her prejudiced views against black people are wrong, St. Clare purchases Topsy, a young black slave, and asks Ophelia to educate her.After Tom has lived with the St. Clares for two years, Eva grows very ill. Before she dies she experiences a vision of heaven, which she shares with the people around her. As a result of her death and vision, the other characters resolve to change their lives, with Ophelia promising to throw off her personal prejudices against blacks, Topsy saying she will better herself, and St. Clare pledging to free Tom.Tom sold to Simon LegreeBefore St. Clare can follow through on his pledge, he dies after being stabbed outside a tavern. His wife reneges on her late husband's vow and sells Tom at auction to a vicious plantation owner named Simon Legree. Tom is taken to rural Louisiana with other new slaves including Emmeline, whom Simon Legree has purchased to use as a sex slave.Legree begins to hate Tom when Tom refuses Legree's order to whip his fellow slave. Legree beats Tom viciously and resolves to crush his new slave's faith in God. Despite Legree's cruelty, Tom refuses to stop reading his Bible and comforting the other slaves as best he can. While at the plantation, Tom meets Cassy, another slave whom Legree used as a sex slave. Cassy tells her story to Tom. She was previously separated from her son and daughter when they were sold. She became pregnant again but killed the child because she could not tolerate having another child separated from her.Tom Loker, changed after being healed by the Quakers, returns to the story. He has helped George, Eliza, and Harry enter Canada from Lake Erie and become free. In Louisiana, Uncle Tom almost succumbs to hopelessness as his faith in God is tested by the hardships of the plantation. He has two visions, one of Jesus and one of Eva, which renew his resolve to remain a faithful Christian, even unto death.He encourages Cassy to escape, which she does, taking Emmeline with her. When Tom refuses to tell Legree where Cassy and Emmeline have gone, Legree orders his overseers to kill Tom. As Tom is dying, he forgives the overseers who savagely beat him. Humbled by the character of the man they have killed, both men become Christians. George Shelby, Arthur Shelby's son, arrives to buy Tom's freedom, but Tom dies shortly after they meet.Final sectionOn their boat ride to freedom, Cassy and Emmeline meet George Harris' sister Madame de Thoux and accompany her to Canada. Madame de Thoux and George Harris were separated in their childhood. Cassy discovers that Eliza is her long-lost daughter who was sold as a child. Now that their family is together again, they travel to France and eventually Liberia, the African nation created for former American slaves. George Shelby returns to the Kentucky farm, where after his father's death, he frees all his slaves. George Shelby urges them to remember Tom's sacrifice every time they look at his cabin. He decides to lead a pious Christian life just as Uncle Tom did.Major themesUncle Tom's Cabin is dominated by a single theme: the evil and immorality of slavery.[65] While Stowe weaves other subthemes throughout her text, such as the moral authority of motherhood and the power of Christian love,[4] she emphasizes the connections between these and the horrors of slavery. Stowe sometimes changed the story's voice so she could give a \"homily\" on the destructive nature of slavery[66] (such as when a white woman on the steamboat carrying Tom further south states, \"The most dreadful part of slavery, to my mind, is its outrages of feelings and affections—the separating of families, for example.\").[67] One way Stowe showed the evil of slavery[49] was how this \"peculiar institution\" forcibly separated families from each other.[68]One of the subthemes presented in the novel is temperance.[69] Stowe made it somewhat subtle and in some cases she wove it into events that would also support the dominant theme. One example of this is when Augustine St. Clare is killed, he attempted to stop a brawl between two inebriated men in a cafe and was stabbed. Another example is the death of Prue, who was whipped to death for being drunk on a consistent basis; however, her reasons for doing so is due to the loss of her baby. In the opening of the novel, the fates of Eliza and her son are being discussed between slave owners over wine. Considering that Stowe intended this to be a subtheme, this scene could foreshadow future events that put alcohol in a bad light.[70]Because Stowe saw motherhood as the \"ethical and structural model for all of American life\"[71] and also believed that only women had the moral authority to save[72] the United States from the demon of slavery, another major theme of Uncle Tom's Cabin is the moral power and sanctity of women.[73] Through characters like Eliza, who escapes from slavery to save her young son (and eventually reunites her entire family), or Eva, who is seen as the \"ideal Christian\",[74] Stowe shows how she believed women could save those around them from even the worst injustices. Though later critics have noted that Stowe's female characters are often domestic clichés instead of realistic women,[75] Stowe's novel \"reaffirmed the importance of women's influence\" and helped pave the way for the women's rights movement in the following decades.[76]Stowe's puritanical religious beliefs show up in the novel's final, overarching theme—the exploration of the nature of Christian love[4][77] and how she feels Christian theology is fundamentally incompatible with slavery.[78] This theme is most evident when Tom urges St. Clare to \"look away to Jesus\" after the death of St. Clare's beloved daughter Eva. After Tom dies, George Shelby eulogizes Tom by saying, \"What a thing it is to be a Christian.\"[79] Because Christian themes play such a large role in Uncle Tom's Cabin—and because of Stowe's frequent use of direct authorial interjections on religion and faith—the novel often takes the \"form of a sermon\".[80]Literary theoriesOver the years scholars have postulated a number of theories about what Stowe was trying to say with the novel (aside from the major theme of condemning slavery). For example, as an ardent Christian and active abolitionist, Stowe placed many of her religious beliefs into the novel.[81] Some scholars have stated that Stowe saw her novel as offering a solution to the moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Was the use of violence to oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally defensible?[82] Which of Stowe's characters should be emulated, the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris?[83] Stowe's solution was similar to Ralph Waldo Emerson's: God's will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them.[84]Scholars have also seen the novel as expressing the values and ideas of the Free Will Movement.[85] In this view, the character of George Harris embodies the principles of free labor, and the complex character of Ophelia represents those Northerners who condoned compromise with slavery. In contrast to Ophelia is Dinah, who operates on passion. During the course of the novel Ophelia is transformed, just as the Republican Party (three years later) proclaimed that the North must transform itself and stand up for its antislavery principles.[86]Feminist theory can also be seen at play in Stowe's book, with the novel as a critique of the patriarchal nature of slavery.[87] For Stowe, blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently, she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society.[88]The book has also been seen as an attempt to redefine masculinity as a necessary step toward the abolition of slavery.[89] In this view, abolitionists had begun to resist the vision of aggressive and dominant men that the conquest and colonization of the early 19th century had fostered. To change the notion of manhood so that men could oppose slavery without jeopardizing their self-image or their standing in society, some abolitionists drew on principles of women's suffrage and Christianity as well as passivism, and praised men for cooperation, compassion, and civic spirit. Others within the abolitionist movement argued for conventional, aggressive masculine action. All the men in Stowe's novel are representations of either one kind of man or the other.[90]Uncle Tom's Cabin is written in the sentimental[3][91] and melodramatic style common to 19th-century sentimental novels[8] and domestic fiction (also called women's fiction). These genres were the most popular novels of Stowe's time and were \"written by, for, and about women\"[92] along with featuring a writing style that evoked a reader's sympathy and emotion.[93]Uncle Tom's Cabin has been called a \"representative\" example of a sentimental novel.[94]The power in this type of writing can be seen in the reaction of contemporary readers. Georgiana May, a friend of Stowe's, wrote a letter to the author, saying: \"I was up last night long after one o'clock, reading and finishing Uncle Tom's Cabin. I could not leave it any more than I could have left a dying child.\"[95] Another reader is described as obsessing on the book at all hours and having considered renaming her daughter Eva.[96] Evidently the death of Little Eva affected a lot of people at that time, because in 1852, 300 baby girls in Boston alone were given that name.[96]Despite this positive reaction from readers, for decades literary critics dismissed the style found in Uncle Tom's Cabin and other sentimental novels because these books were written by women and so prominently featured what one critic called \"women's sloppy emotions\".[97] Another literary critic said that had the novel not been about slavery, \"it would be just another sentimental novel\",[98] and another described the book as \"primarily a derivative piece of hack work\".[99] In The Literary History of the United States, George F. Whicher called Uncle Tom's Cabin \"Sunday-school fiction\", full of \"broadly conceived melodrama, humor, and pathos\".[100]In 1985 Jane Tompkins expressed a different view with her famous defense of the book in \"Sentimental Power: Uncle Tom's Cabin and the Politics of Literary History.\"[97][101] Tompkins praised the style so many other critics had dismissed, writing that sentimental novels showed how women's emotions had the power to change the world for the better. She also said that the popular domestic novels of the 19th century, including Uncle Tom's Cabin, were remarkable for their \"intellectual complexity, ambition, and resourcefulness\"; and that Uncle Tom's Cabin offers a \"critique of American society far more devastating than any delivered by better-known critics such as Hawthorne and Melville.\"[102].mw-parser-output .hidden-begin{box-sizing:border-box;width:100%;padding:5px;border:none;font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .hidden-title{font-weight:bold;line-height:1.6;text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .hidden-content{text-align:left}@media all and (max-width:500px){.mw-parser-output .hidden-begin{width:auto!important;clear:none!important;float:none!important}}\nEvents leading to the American Civil War\nNorthwest Ordinance (1787)\nKentucky and Virginia Resolutions (1798–99)\nEnd of Atlantic slave trade\nMissouri Compromise (1820)\nTariff of Abominations (1828)\nNat Turner's Rebellion (1831)\nNullification crisis (1832–33)\nAbolition of slavery in the British Empire (1834)\nTexas Revolution (1835–36)\nUnited States v.

The novel is considered an influential[104] \"landmark\" of protest literature.[16]Contemporary reaction in United States and around the worldUncle Tom's Cabin had an \"incalculable\"[102] impact on the 19th-century world and captured the imagination of many Americans. In a likely apocryphal story that alludes to the novel's impact, when Abraham Lincoln met Stowe in 1862 he supposedly commented, \"So this is the little lady who started this great war.\"[10][11][105] Historians are undecided if Lincoln actually said this line, and in a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln no mention of this comment was made.[106] Many writers have also credited the novel with focusing Northern anger at the injustices of slavery and the Fugitive Slave Law[106] and helping to fuel the abolitionist movement.[9][3]Union general and politician James Baird Weaver said that the book convinced him to become active in the abolitionist movement.[107]Frederick Douglass was \"convinced both of the social uses of the novel and of Stowe's humanitarianism\" and heavily promoted the novel in his newspaper during the book's initial release.[108] Though Douglass said Uncle Tom's Cabin was \"a work of marvelous depth and power,\" he also published criticism of the novel, most prominently by Martin Delany. In a series of letters in the paper, Delany accused Stowe of \"borrowing (and thus profiting) from the work of black writers to compose her novel\" and chastised Stowe for her \"apparent support of black colonization to Africa.\"[108] Delany was \"one of the most out-spoken black critics\" of Uncle Tom's Cabin at the time and later wrote Blake; or the Huts of America, a novel where an African American \"chooses violent rebellion over Tom's resignation.\"[109]White people in the American South were outraged at the novel's release,[49] with the book also roundly criticized by slavery supporters.[35] Southern novelist William Gilmore Simms declared the work utterly false[110] while also calling it slanderous.[111] Reactions ranged from a bookseller in Mobile, Alabama, being forced to leave town for selling the novel[49] to threatening letters sent to Stowe (including a package containing a slave's severed ear).[49] Many Southern writers, like Simms, soon wrote their own books in opposition to Stowe's novel.[112]Some critics highlighted Stowe's paucity of life-experience relating to Southern life, saying that it led her to create inaccurate descriptions of the region. For instance, she had never been to a Southern plantation. Stowe always said she based the characters of her book on stories she was told by runaway slaves in Cincinnati. It is reported that \"She observed firsthand several incidents which galvanized her to write [the] famous anti-slavery novel. Scenes she observed on the Ohio River, including seeing a husband and wife being sold apart, as well as newspaper and magazine accounts and interviews, contributed material to the emerging plot.\"[113]In response to these criticisms, in 1853 Stowe published A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin, an attempt to document the veracity of the novel's depiction of slavery.[31] In the book, Stowe discusses each of the major characters in Uncle Tom's Cabin and cites \"real life equivalents\" to them while also mounting a more \"aggressive attack on slavery in the South than the novel itself had\".[34] Like the novel, A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin was a best-seller, but although Stowe claimed A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin documented her previously consulted sources, she actually read many of the cited works only after the publication of her novel.[34]Uncle Tom's Cabin also created great interest in the United Kingdom. The first London edition appeared in May 1852 and sold 200,000 copies.[49] Some of this interest was due to anti-Americanism in Britain. As English lawyer Nassau William Senior argued, \"The evil passions which Uncle Tom gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance, but national jealousy and national vanity. We have long been smarting under the conceit of America—we are tired of hearing her boast that she is the freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen. Our clergy hate her voluntary system—our Tories hate her democrats—our Whigs hate her parvenus—our Radicals hate her litigiousness, her insolence, and her ambition. All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy... She taught us how to prove that democrats may be tyrants, that an aristocracy of caste is more oppressive than an aristocracy of station... Our pity for the victim is swallowed up by our hatred of the tyrant.\"[114]Stowe sent a copy of the book to Charles Dickens, who wrote her in response: \"I have read your book with the deepest interest and sympathy, and admire, more than I can express to you, both the generous feeling which inspired it, and the admirable power with which it is executed.\"[115] The historian and politician Thomas Babington Macaulay wrote in 1852 that \"it is the most valuable addition that America has made to English literature.\"[116]Charles Francis Adams Sr., the American ambassador to Britain during the Civil War, argued later that \"Uncle Tom's Cabin; or Life among the Lowly, published in 1852, exercised, largely from fortuitous circumstances, a more immediate, considerable and dramatic world-influence than any other book ever printed.\"[117]Leo Tolstoy claimed that Uncle Tom's Cabin was a greater work than any play written by Shakespeare because it flowed from the love of God and man.[118]20th century and modern criticismIn the 20th century, a number of writers attacked Uncle Tom's Cabin not only for the stereotypes the novel had created about African-Americans but also because of \"the utter disdain of the Tom character by the black community\".[119] These writers included Richard Wright with his collection Uncle Tom's Children (1938) and Chester Himes with his 1943 short story \"Heaven Has Changed\".[119]Ralph Ellison also critiqued the book with his 1952 novel Invisible Man, with Ellison figuratively killing Uncle Tom in the opening chapter.[119]In 1945 James Baldwin published his influential and infamous critical essay \"Everybody's Protest Novel\".[120] In the essay, Baldwin described Uncle Tom's Cabin as \"a bad novel, having, in its self-righteousness, virtuous sentimentality\".[121] He argued that the novel lacked psychological depth, and that Stowe, \"was not so much a novelist as an impassioned pamphleteer\".[122][123]Edward Rothstein has claimed that Baldwin missed the point and that the purpose of the novel was \"to treat slavery not as a political issue but as an individually human one – and ultimately a challenge to Christianity itself.\"[123]George Orwell in his essay \"Good Bad Books\", first published in Tribune in November 1945, claims that \"perhaps the supreme example of the 'good bad' book is Uncle Tom's Cabin. It is an unintentionally ludicrous book, full of preposterous melodramatic incidents; it is also deeply moving and essentially true; it is hard to say which quality outweighs the other.\" But he concludes \"I would back Uncle Tom's Cabin to outlive the complete works of Virginia Woolf or George Moore, though I know of no strictly literary test which would show where the superiority lies.\"[124]The negative associations related to Uncle Tom's Cabin, in particular how the novel and associated plays created and popularized racial stereotypes, have to some extent obscured the book's historical impact as a \"vital antislavery tool\".[15] After the turn of the millennium, scholars such as Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Hollis Robbins have re-examined Uncle Tom's Cabin in what has been called a \"serious attempt to resurrect it as both a central document in American race relations and a significant moral and political exploration of the character of those relations.\"[123]In China, Uncle Tom's Cabin experienced a revival of interest in the early 1960s.[125]: 55  In the Chinese communist view of the book, Uncle Tom was interpreted as having been betrayed by his \"Christian consciousness.\"[125]: 55  In 1961, Sun Weishi directed a stage play adaptation of the book.[125]: 55  The revival of interest in Uncle Tom's Cabin intersected with the translation and popularization of works by W. E. B. Du Bois, who was viewed as having developed a new spirit of Black resistance.[125]: 54–55 Literary significanceGenerally recognized as the first best-selling novel,[16]Uncle Tom's Cabin greatly influenced development of not only American literature but also protest literature in general.[16][104] Later books that owe a large debt to Uncle Tom's Cabin include The Jungle by Upton Sinclair and Silent Spring by Rachel Carson.[17]Despite this undisputed significance, Uncle Tom's Cabin has been called \"a blend of children's fable and propaganda\".[126] The novel has also been dismissed by several literary critics as \"merely a sentimental novel\";[98] critic George Whicher stated in his Literary History of the United States that \"Nothing attributable to Mrs. Stowe or her handiwork can account for the novel's enormous vogue; its author's resources as a purveyor of Sunday-school fiction were not remarkable. She had at most a ready command of broadly conceived melodrama, humor, and pathos, and of these popular sentiments she compounded her book.\"[100]Other critics, though, have praised the novel. Edmund Wilson stated that \"To expose oneself in maturity to Uncle Tom's Cabin may therefore prove a startling experience. It is a much more impressive work than one has ever been allowed to suspect.\"[127] Jane Tompkins stated that the novel is one of the classics of American literature and wonders if many literary critics dismiss the book because it was simply too popular during its day.[92]Many modern scholars and readers have criticized the book for condescending racist descriptions of the black characters' appearances, speech, and behavior, as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate.[128] The novel's creation and use of common stereotypes about African Americans[12] is significant because Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century.[7] As a result, the book (along with illustrations from the book[39] and associated stage productions) played a major role in perpetuating and solidifying such stereotypes into the American psyche.[129][128]In the 1960s and 1970s, the Black Power and Black Arts Movements attacked the novel, claiming that the character of Uncle Tom engaged in \"race betrayal\", and that Tom made slaves out to be worse than slave owners.[123]Among the stereotypes of blacks in Uncle Tom's Cabin[13][15] are the \"happy darky\" (in the lazy, carefree character of Sam); the light-skinned tragic mulatto as a sex object (in the characters of Eliza, Cassy, and Emmeline); the affectionate, dark-skinned female mammy (through several characters, including Mammy, a cook at the St. Clare plantation); the pickaninny stereotype of black children (in the character of Topsy); and the Uncle Tom, an African American who is too eager to please white people.[53]Stowe intended Tom to be a \"noble hero\" and a Christ-like figure who, like Jesus at his crucifixion, forgives the people responsible for his death. The false stereotype of Tom as a \"subservient fool who bows down to the white man\", and the resulting derogatory term \"Uncle Tom\", resulted from staged \"Tom Shows\", which sometimes replaced Tom's grim death with an upbeat ending where Tom causes his oppressors to see the error of their ways, and they all reconcile happily. Stowe had no control over these shows and their alteration of her story.[53]Main article: Anti-Tom literatureIn response to Uncle Tom's Cabin, writers in the Southern United States produced a number of books to rebut Stowe's novel.[130]Uncle Tom's Cabin was published in 1852, and very quickly seven Anti-Tom novels were published in 1852 and six more in 1853. This so-called Anti-Tom literature generally took a pro-slavery viewpoint, arguing that the issues of slavery as depicted in Stowe's book were overblown and incorrect.[131] The novels in this genre tended to feature a benign white patriarchal master and a pure wife, both of whom presided over childlike slaves in a benevolent extended family style plantation. The novels either implied or directly stated that African Americans were a childlike people[132] unable to live their lives without being directly overseen by white people.[133]Among the most famous anti-Tom books are The Sword and the Distaff by William Gilmore Simms, Aunt Phillis's Cabin by Mary Henderson Eastman, and The Planter's Northern Bride by Caroline Lee Hentz,[134] with the last author having been a close personal friend of Stowe's when the two lived in Cincinnati. Simms' book was published a few months after Stowe's novel, and it contains a number of sections and discussions disputing Stowe's book and her view of slavery. Hentz's 1854 novel, widely read at the time but now largely forgotten, offers a defense of slavery as seen through the eyes of a Northern woman—the daughter of an abolitionist, no less—who marries a Southern slave owner.[135]In the decade between the publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin and the start of the American Civil War, between twenty and thirty anti-Tom books were published (although others continued to be published after the war, including The Leopard's Spots in 1902 by \"professional racist\" Thomas Dixon Jr.).[136] More than half of these anti-Tom books were written by white women, Simms commenting at one point about the \"Seemingly poetic justice of having the Northern woman (Stowe) answered by a Southern woman.\"[137]Plays and Tom showsMain article: Tom showScene in William A. Brady's 1901 revival of the play at the Academy of Music, New York City\nLittle Eva's death scene in Brady's 1901 revival at the Academy of MusicEven though Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel of the 19th century, far more Americans of that time saw the story as a stage play or musical than read the book.[138] Historian Eric Lott estimated that \"for every one of the three hundred thousand who bought the novel in its first year, many more eventually saw the play.\"[139] In 1902, it was reported that a quarter million of these presentations had already been performed in the United States.[140]Given the lax copyright laws of the time, stage plays based on Uncle Tom's Cabin—\"Tom shows\"—began to appear while the novel was still being serialized. Stowe refused to authorize dramatization of her work because of her distrust of drama, although she eventually saw George L. Aiken's version and, according to Francis Underwood, was \"delighted\" by Caroline Howard's portrayal of Topsy.[141] Aiken's stage production was the most popular play in the U.S. and Britain for 75 years.[103] Stowe's refusal to authorize a particular dramatic version left the field clear for any number of adaptations, some launched for (various) political reasons and others as simply commercial theatrical ventures.[142][143]No international copyright laws existed at the time. The book and plays were translated into several languages. Stowe received no money, which could have meant as much as \"three-fourths of her just and legitimate wages\".[144]All the Tom shows appear to have incorporated elements of melodrama and blackface minstrelsy.[15] These plays varied tremendously in their politics—some faithfully reflected Stowe's sentimentalized antislavery politics, while others were more moderate, or even pro-slavery.[145] Many of the productions featured demeaning racial caricatures of black people;[15] some productions also featured songs by Stephen Foster, including \"My Old Kentucky Home\", \"Old Folks at Home\", and \"Massa's in the Cold Ground\".[138] The best-known Tom shows were those of George Aiken and H. J. Conway.[146]The many stage variants of Uncle Tom's Cabin \"dominated northern popular culture... for several years\" during the 19th century,[147] and the plays were still being performed in the early 20th century.[148]FilmsMain article: Film adaptations of Uncle Tom's CabinUncle Tom's Cabin has been adapted several times as a film. Most of these movies were created during the silent film era (Uncle Tom's Cabin was the most-filmed book of that time period).[149] Because of the continuing popularity of both the book and \"Tom\" shows, audiences were already familiar with the characters and the plot, making it easier for the film to be understood without spoken words.[149]The first film version of Uncle Tom's Cabin was one of the earliest full-length movies, although full-length at that time meant between 10 and 14 minutes.[150] This 1903 film, directed by Edwin S. Porter, used white actors in blackface in the major roles and black performers only as extras. This version was evidently similar to many of the \"Tom Shows\" of earlier decades and featured several stereotypes about blacks, such as having the slaves dance in almost any context, including at a slave auction.[150]In 1910, a three-reel Vitagraph Company of America production was directed by J. Stuart Blackton and adapted by Eugene Mullin. According to The Dramatic Mirror, this film was \"a decided innovation\" in motion pictures and \"the first time an American company\" released a dramatic film in three reels. Until then, full-length movies of the time were 15 minutes long and contained only one reel of film. The movie starred Florence Turner, Mary Fuller, Edwin R. Phillips, Flora Finch, Genevieve Tobin and Carlyle Blackwell, Sr.[151]At least four more movie adaptations were created in the next two decades. The last silent film version was released in 1927. Directed by Harry A. Pollard, who played Uncle Tom in a 1913 release of Uncle Tom's Cabin, this two-hour movie was more than a year in production and was the third most expensive picture of the silent era, at a cost of $1.8 million. The black actor Charles Gilpin was originally cast in the title role, but he was fired after the studio decided his \"portrayal was too aggressive\".[152]For several decades after the end of the silent film era, the subject matter of Stowe's novel was judged too sensitive for further film interpretation. In 1946, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer considered filming the story but ceased production after protests led by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.[153] The story was adapted as a play within the musical film version of The King & I. Within the main story, the character of Anna Leonowens gives Tuptim a copy of the book of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Tuptim relates to the anti-slavery themes of the book, and adapts it in to a traditional Siamese play for a state dinner. In this version, called \"The Small House of Uncle Thomas\", the characters are re-written as Buddhists. This version eliminates most of the white slave owners as characters, and focuses only on Tom, Simon, Eliza, Eva, and Topsy. Film versions were created overseas in the following decades, including a 1965 German-language version and a TV soap opera in Brazil called A Cabana do Pai Tomás, which ran for 205 episodes from July 1969 to March 1970.[154] The final film version[155] was a television broadcast in 1987, directed by Stan Lathan and adapted by John Gay. It starred Avery Brooks, Phylicia Rashad, Edward Woodward, Jenny Lewis, Samuel L. Jackson and Endyia Kinney.[156]In addition to film adaptations, versions of Uncle Tom's Cabin have been produced in other formats, including a number of animated cartoons. Uncle Tom's Cabin also influenced movies, including The Birth of a Nation. This controversial 1915 film set the dramatic climax in a slave cabin similar to that of Uncle Tom, where several white Southerners unite with their former enemy (Yankee soldiers) to defend, according to the film's caption, their \"Aryan birthright\". According to scholars, this reuse of such a familiar image of a slave cabin would have resonated with, and been understood by, audiences of the time.[157][158]Notes^ Kaufman 2006, p. 18.\n^ Painter 2000, p. 245.\n^ a b c d DeLombard 2012.\n^ a b c Kurian 2010, p. 580.\n^ de Rosa 2003, On p. 122, de Rosa quotes Tompkins 1985, p. 145 that Stowe's strategy was to destroy slavery through the \"saving power of Christian love\"..\n^ Tompkins 1985, On p. 141, Tompkins writes \"Stowe conceived her book as an instrument for bringing about the day when the world would be ruled not by force, but by Christian love.\".\n^ a b c DiMaggio 2014, p. 15.\n^ a b Smith 2001, p. 221.\n^ a b Goldner 2001, p. 82.\n^ a b Stowe 1911, p. 203.\n^ a b Vollaro 2009.\n^ a b Hulser 2003.\n^ a b Jamieson 2018, p. ??.\n^ a b c d Jones 2019, pp. 1465–1467.\n^ a b c d e Appiah & Gates 2005, p. 544.\n^ a b c d Smith 2008, p. 161.\n^ a b Weinstein 2004, p. 13.\n^ Winship 1999, p. 310.\n^ Gatta 2015, p. 500.\n^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}\"Harriet Beecher Stowe House\".

{"title":"The Godfather","author":"Mario Puzo","published":1969,"fiction":true,"plot":"The Corleone family is one of the Five Families of the New York Mafia. After World War II, the families avoid open warfare in favour of mutual cooperation. The peace is broken after Don Vito Corleone is shot by men working for drug kingpin Virgil \"The Turk\" Sollozzo. Two of Corleone's sons, Santino (Sonny) and Michael, take an active role in the family business with the help of consigliere Tom Hagen and the family's two caporegimes, Peter Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio. When Michael murders Sollozzo and his bodyguard, corrupt NYPD Captain Mark McCluskey, the conflict escalates into a full-scale war which results in Sonny's murder. Michael must return from hiding in Sicily to assume control of the family as the new Don. Under his retired father's tutelage, Michael orchestrates a plan to exact revenge, while relocating the Corleone family's power base to Las Vegas in order to further his goal of legitimizing the family and getting them out of organized crime. This encompasses the murder of all of the Corleone family's enemies, including Michael's brother-in-law Carlo Rizzi, who played a part in Sonny's murder. After selling all of the family's remaining businesses in New York, the Corleones permanently move to Las Vegas.The Corleone family patriarch is Vito Corleone (the Don), whose surname represents the Sicilian town of his birth, Corleone. His birth name is Vittorio Andolini, but after immigrating to the United States following the deaths of his parents and brother, he changed it to the name of his home village as one of his few acts of sentimentality. Vito fathered four children: Sonny Corleone, Fredo Corleone, Michael Corleone, and Connie Corleone. He also has an informally adopted Irish son, Tom Hagen, who became the Corleone family's consigliere (counselor). Vito Corleone is also godfather to the famous singer and movie star Johnny Fontane. The godfather referred to in the title is Vito, but the story's main character becomes Michael. The novel's central storyline details Michael's destiny to succeed his father as the head of the family empire, despite his desire to lead an Americanized life with his girlfriend (and eventual wife) Kay Adams.The Corleone family is a criminal organization with national influence, notably protection, gambling, and union racketeering. Serving as the Don's underboss is his oldest son, Sonny. The operational side of the organization is headed by two caporegimes, Peter Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio. Other significant members of the organization include Connie's abusive husband Carlo Rizzi and enforcers Luca Brasi and Al Neri.In The New York Times, Roger Jellinek wrote that the book was \"bound to be hugely successful, and not simply because the Mafia is in the news. Mr. Puzo's novel is a voyeur’s dream, a skillful fantasy of violent personal power without consequences. The victims of the Corleone 'family' are hoods, or corrupt cops – nobody you or I would actually want to know. Just business, as Don Vito would say, not personal. You never glimpse regular people in the book, let alone meet them, so there is no opportunity to sympathize with anyone but the old patriarch, as he makes the world safe for his beloved 'family.'\"[2] The novel remained on The New York Times Best Seller list for 67 weeks and sold over nine million copies in two years.[3]The novel is #53 on the PBS The Great American Read list of \"America's 100 most-loved books\".[4] In the UK, the novel was #91 on the 2003 BBC The Big Read list of the top 200 novels in the United Kingdom, based on the goal of finding the \"Nation's Best-loved Novel\".Main article: The GodfatherThe 1972 film adaptation of the novel was released with Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Mario Puzo assisted with both the writing of the screenplay and other production tasks. The film grossed approximately $269 million worldwide and won various awards, including three Academy Awards, five Golden Globes and one Grammy. The film is considered to be tremendously significant in cinematic history. The sequel, The Godfather Part II won six Oscars, and became the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.The film's plot follows the novel except for such details as backstories of some characters that are excluded, although they were filmed. Some of this footage was included in later re-edited versions such as, \"The Godfather Saga.\" The subplot involving Johnny Fontane in Hollywood was not filmed. The most significant deviation of the film from the novel was that the latter had a more positive ending than the film in which Kay Corleone accepts Michael's decision to take over his father's business. The film ends with Kay's realization of Michael's callousness, a theme that would develop in the second and third films, which are largely not based on the original novel. Vito Corleone's backstory appeared in the second film, with his character portrayed by Robert De Niro.In 1984, Puzo's literary sequel to The Godfather was published. Titled The Sicilian, it chronicles the life of \"Giuliano\" (Salvatore Giuliano) but the Corleone family is featured heavily throughout, Michael Corleone in particular. Chronologically this story sits between Michael's exile to Sicily in 1950 (Book VI) and his return to the United States (Book VII). For copyright reasons, the Corleone family involvement was cut from the Michael Cimino film adaptation, which is not considered part of the Godfather film series.In 2004, Random House published a sequel to Puzo's The Godfather, The Godfather Returns, by Mark Winegardner. A further sequel by Winegardner, The Godfather's Revenge, was released in 2006. These novels continue the story from Puzo's novel.The Godfather Returns picks up the story immediately after the end of Puzo's The Godfather. It covers the years 1955 to 1962, as well as providing significant backstory for Michael Corleone's character prior to the events of the first novel. The events of the film The Godfather Part II all take place within the timeframe of this novel, but are only mentioned in the background. The novel contains an appendix that attempts to correlate the events of the novels with the events of the films.The Godfather's Revenge covers the years 1963 to 1964.Continuing Puzo's habit, as seen in The Godfather, of featuring characters who are close analogs of real-life events and public figures (as Johnny Fontane is an analog of Frank Sinatra), Winegardner features in his two Godfather novels analogs of Joseph, John F. and Robert F. Kennedy, as well as alleged organized crime figure Carlos Marcello (Carlo Tramonti). In The Godfather Returns, Winegardner also dramatizes the sweep of organized crime arrests that took place in Apalachin, New York, in 1957.Winegardner uses all of the characters from the Puzo novels and created a few of his own, most notably Nick Geraci, a Corleone soldier who plays a pivotal role in the sequel novels. Winegardner further develops characters from the original novel, such as Fredo Corleone, Tom Hagen, and Johnny Fontane.In 2012, a prequel based on an unproduced screenplay by Mario Puzo titled The Family Corleone, was written by Ed Falco. It tells the story of how Vito Corleone rises to Don and how Sonny Corleone and Tom Hagen enter the family business.The Corleone family closely resembles the Karamazov family in The Brothers Karamazov: a powerful father, an impulsive oldest son, a philosophical son, a sweet-tempered son, and an adopted stepson who is maintained as an employee. Honoré de Balzac's novel Le Père Goriot (1835) has been the inspiration for notable lines that have gained wide popularity in cinema history. Similarly, Puzo opened his 1969 novel with an epigraph popularly attributed to Balzac: \"Behind every great fortune there is a crime.\" The saying is most likely evolved over time from Balzac's original text: \"The secret of a great success for which you are at a loss to account is a crime that has never been found out because it was properly executed.\"[5]\"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\" was included in both the original Puzo novel and in the film adaptation. It is the second-ranking cinematic quote included in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes (2005) by the American Film Institute. Its origin may be from the same work to which Balzac is credited with the opening epigraph. Balzac wrote of Vautrin telling Eugene: \"In that case, I will make you an offer that no one would decline.\"[6]Large parts of the novel are based upon reality, notably the history of the \"Five Families\", the Mafia organization in New York and the surrounding area. The novel also includes many allusions to real-life mobsters and their associates. For example, Johnny Fontane is based on Frank Sinatra,[7][8] and Moe Greene on Bugsy Siegel.[9][10] In addition, the character of Vito Corleone was a composite of real-life organized crime bosses Frank Costello and Carlo Gambino.[11]^ \"Trio of Best-Sellers?\", Books Happening column by Gene Shalit, Los Angeles Times, February 23, 1969, \"Calendar\" section, p46 (\"'The Godfather'... could be the sleeper of the season...

{"title":"Catching Fire","author":"Suzanne Collins","published":2009,"fiction":true,"plot":"Six months after winning the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark have returned home to District 12, the poorest sector of Panem. Prior to Katniss and Peeta's \"Victory Tour\" of the country, President Snow visits Katniss and tells her that her televised acts of defiance in the previous Games have inspired rebellion among the districts. Snow demands that Katniss convince the country that she was acting out of love for Peeta, not against the Capitol, or her family and best friend Gale Hawthorne will be executed. Katniss reveals this threat to her mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, but not to Peeta.The tour's first stop is District 11, home of Katniss's Hunger Games ally Rue. Peeta announces that he will give part of his winnings to the families of Rue and fellow tribute Thresh, and Katniss delivers an impromptu, heartfelt speech expressing her gratitude to the fallen tributes. An old man salutes Katniss, joined by the crowd; to her horror, the old man is immediately executed. Katniss tells Peeta of Snow's threat, and they continue the tour as normal. Hoping to placate Snow, Peeta proposes to Katniss during a televised interview in the Capitol, which she accepts. However, Snow remains dissatisfied with her performance, leaving her afraid for her loved ones.Returning to District 12, now overrun with harsher Peacekeepers to enforce the Capitol's rule, Gale is caught poaching and is publicly whipped until Haymitch intervenes. While hunting in the woods, Katniss encounters Bonnie and Twill, refugees from District 8, whose uprising has failed. Bonnie and Twill plan to reach District 13 – believed to be destroyed in the first rebellion against the Capitol – hoping that the residents are actually underground. Katniss is injured climbing back over District 12's now live electric fence. Preparing for her upcoming wedding, Katniss learns that Districts 3 and 4 have also risen up against the Capitol.The Capitol announces the 75th Hunger Games with a twist – tributes will be selected from the surviving victors of the previous Games. As District 12's sole female victor, Katniss has to compete alongside either Haymitch or Peeta. Haymitch is chosen and is unable to stop Peeta from volunteering in his place. At the Capitol, Haymitch urges Katniss to find allies, but she bonds with the weakest tributes. In the televised interview, Katniss's stylist Cinna has Katniss' wedding gown transformed into a black dress of feathers resembling a mockingjay. Trying to stop the Games, Peeta lies in the interview that Katniss is pregnant. Before Katniss is sent into the arena, she watches helplessly as Cinna is beaten and dragged out by Peacekeepers.Katniss and Peeta ally themselves with Finnick Odair from District 4 and Mags, his 80-year-old mentor. Peeta is knocked out by the jungle arena's force field, and the party later has to flee from a poisonous fog. Mags sacrifices herself to allow Finnick to save the weakened Peeta. Katniss and Peeta ally with Johanna Mason from District 7 and \"exceptionally smart\" Beetee and Wiress from District 3. Wiress reveals that the arena is arranged like a clock, with each danger occurring at a fixed time and place for one hour. Wiress is killed, and in retaliation Katniss and Johanna kill the District 1 victors Gloss and Cashmere. The remaining members of Katniss's group work on Beetee's plan to harness lightning to electrocute the District 2 victors, who later interfere and disrupt the plan. Katniss uses her bow and arrow to direct the lightning into the force field, destroying it and knocking her unconscious. Meanwhile, Peeta kills the District 2 male, Brutus.Katniss wakes up en route to District 13 with Finnick, Beetee, and Haymitch. She learns from Haymitch and Plutarch Heavensbee, the Head Gamemaker, that there had been a secret plan to rescue Katniss, now the living symbol of the rebellion. Peeta, along with Johanna and District 2 tribute Enobaria, have been captured by the Capitol. She later learns from Gale that, though her family and some other residents have escaped, District 12 has been destroyed.The main themes of Catching Fire include survival, sacrifice, and the conflict between interdependence and independence. As reviewer Margo Dill noted, \"In [Catching Fire], Katniss and Peeta are definitely interdependent. They are both helping each other to survive. As a matter of fact, they want the other one to survive more than they do themselves.\" Dill goes on to explain how this likely increases the chances of each character dying.[2]Government control is another important theme, both within the book and throughout the entire trilogy. After suppressing the first rebellion, the Capitol establishes rules in order to restrict and control the citizens' lives. Examples noted by Dill include that, \"the 75th annual Hunger Games have 'new' rules that cause Katniss and Peeta to be in danger once again. More 'Peacekeepers' are placed in districts to diminish any hope that the citizens started to have after the last Hunger Games.\"[2] Another major theme throughout the trilogy is the media and the influence or power that popular culture has over the emotions, wishes and views of society. Other themes in the book include morality, obedience, sacrifice, redemption, love, and law.[3]Catching Fire had a preliminary hardcover release date of September 8, 2009, which was moved up to September 1 in response to requests by retailers to move the release to before Labor Day and the start of school for many readers.[4] It was also published as an audiobook on the same day.[5]Advance reading copies were available at BookExpo America in New York City,[6] and were sent out to some booksellers, and offered as prizes in Scholastic's \"How Would You Survive\" writing contest in May 2009. An eBook version was also published on June 3, 2010.[5]Catching Fire had an initial print of 350,000 copies,[4] a number which had grown to over 750,000 by February 2010.[7] The release of Mockingjay, the third novel of the series, followed on August 24, 2010.[8][9] As of March 2012[update], the book has sold over 10 million copies.[10]Publishers Weekly wrote, \"If this second installment spends too much time recapping events from book one, it doesn't disappoint when it segues into the pulse-pounding action readers have come to expect.\"[11]Booklist commented on how the \"unadorned prose provides an open window to perfect pacing and electrifying world building\".[3]The New York Times also gave a positive review, writing, \"Collins has done that rare thing. She has written a sequel that improves upon the first book. As a reader, I felt excited and even hopeful: could it be that this series and its characters were actually going somewhere?\" The review also praised Collins' development of the character of Katniss.[12]The Plain Dealer wrote, \"The very last sentence of Catching Fire will leave readers gasping. Not to mention primed for part three.\"[13]However, not all reviews were positive. The same review from The Plain Dealer expressed displeasure at how, \"after 150 pages of romantic dithering, I was tapping my foot to move on.\"[13] A review from Entertainment Weekly opined that the book was weaker than the first and wrote, \"Katniss pretends to be in love with her sweet-natured Games teammate Peeta Mellark, but she secretly pines for brooding Gale, a childhood friend. Except — why? There's little distinction between the two thinly imagined guys, other than the fact that Peeta has a dopier name. Collins conjures none of the erotic energy that makes Twilight, for instance, so creepily alluring.\"[14]In addition, Time magazine placed Catching Fire at number four on its list of the top 100 fiction books of 2009,[15] while People magazine rated it the eighth Best Book of 2009.[16] It also won the Publishers Weekly's 2009 award for Best Book of the Year.[17]Main article: The Hunger Games: Catching FireLionsgate announced that The Hunger Games: Catching Fire was to be released on November 22, 2013,[18] as a sequel to the film adaptation of The Hunger Games. In April 2012, it was announced that Gary Ross, director of The Hunger Games, would not return due to a \"tight\" and \"fitted\" schedule.[19]Francis Lawrence was officially announced as the director for Catching Fire on May 3, 2012.[20] In addition to the returning cast members from the first film, the film's new cast includes Jena Malone as Johanna Mason,[21]Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee,[22]Lynn Cohen as Mags,[23]Alan Ritchson as Gloss,[24]Sam Claflin as Finnick,[25] and Jeffrey Wright as Beetee.[26] Production officially began on September 10, 2012, and concluded on December 21, 2012.[27] Shooting first took place in and around metropolitan Atlanta. Several District 11 scenes were also filmed in the rural areas of Macon County, Georgia, and the rest of production took place in Hawaii. Some of the wooded scenes were filmed in Oakland, New Jersey.[28]The film was successful, grossing more than $800 million to become the fifth highest-grossing film at the box office in 2013[29] and receiving positive reviews from critics. It would be followed by the two part film adaptation of the third novel, Mockingjay, released on November 21, 2014 (Part 1) and November 20, 2015 (Part 2).[30]^ \"Mockingjay proves the Hunger Games is must-read literature\". io9.

{"title":"Mockingjay","author":"Suzanne Collins","published":2010,"fiction":true,"plot":"Following Catching Fire, Katniss Everdeen adjusts to life underground in District 13, headquarters of the rebellion in Panem. Her mother, sister, mentor Haymitch Abernathy, and friend Gale Hawthorne are among refugees from District 12 now resettled in 13, as well as fellow former Hunger Games victors Finnick and Beetee. Katniss reluctantly agrees to be the \"Mockingjay” – the symbol of the rebellion – for rebel propaganda, on the condition that District 13's President Alma Coin grants immunity to all surviving Hunger Games tributes, including Peeta Mellark and Finnick's lover Annie Cresta, who have been captured by the Capitol.Struggling to perform convincingly in a studio, Katniss is sent to a rebel hospital in District 8 to film. When an air raid begins, she disobeys orders and joins in the fighting, giving an impassioned televised speech. The Capitol tortures Peeta to demoralize Katniss and televises interviews with him in which he is visibly deteriorating, but still manages to warn the rebels of an impending attack. A rescue team manages to extract Peeta along with Annie and fellow Quarter Quell tribute Johanna Mason, but on their first reunion Peeta attempts to strangle Katniss. The rebels discover that Peeta has been brainwashed through a method called “hijacking”, implanting false memories and torturing him to believe Katniss is evil and that their previous relationship was completely fake.While medics and friends from District 12 attempt to rehabilitate Peeta, Katniss withdraws from him and rededicates herself to the war effort. She and Gale are sent to District 2, one of the Capitol’s last strongholds, where she struggles with the rebels’ methods and indifference to suffering in the pursuit of their goals. She attempts to save a District 2 soldier escaping the rebels’ trap, and is shot on live television. As the rebels close in, Katniss is assigned to a squad and sent with a film crew to shoot combat in the Capitol. When President Coin sends Peeta, who is still dangerous and unpredictable, to join them, Katniss suspects Coin wants her dead, and decides to break away from the group to infiltrate the Capitol and kill Snow. The group’s leader, Boggs, is killed and transfers command to Katniss, and her squad agrees to carry out her plan. In the ensuing urban warfare, many of Katniss's squad are killed, including Finnick, who is devoured by genetically-modified reptiles. As they reach Snow’s mansion, a Capitol hovercraft drops bombs among a group of children being used as human shields. Rebel medics, including Prim, rush in to help the injured children, and the remaining bombs detonate, killing them all.As she recuperates, Katniss, profoundly depressed over her sister's death, learns the rebels have taken over the Capitol and Snow is to be publicly executed. She confronts Snow, who claims that Coin orchestrated the bombing of the children to turn Snow's remaining supporters against him, and that District 13 under Coin has been using the rebellion to position themselves in power. Katniss realizes that the double-wave bombing that killed Prim was similar to a tactic previously suggested by Gale. Coin hosts a referendum for the remaining Victors, proposing to host another Hunger Games for the Capitol children, and Katniss votes in favor. At Snow's execution, Katniss is supposed to carry out the death sentence, but at the last minute shoots Coin instead.In the aftermath of the war, rebel Commander Paylor of District 8 is voted President in Coin’s place. Katniss is acquitted of murder by reason of insanity and sent home to District 12, while her mother and Gale live in other districts supporting the post-war rehabilitation efforts. She rekindles her relationship with Peeta, who has slowly recovered his memories and sanity. Twenty years later, Katniss and Peeta are married and have two children. Under Paylor's administration, the Hunger Games are abolished, with the arenas replaced by memorials. Katniss has found peace in her new life, but still dreads the day her children learn about their parents' involvement in the war and the Games. She comforts her young daughter with a game, in which she reminds herself of every good thing she has ever seen someone do.Reviews have noted many themes in the previous books that are also explored in Mockingjay. A review from The Baltimore Sun noted that \"the themes of the series, including physical hardships, loyalty in extreme circumstances and traversing morally ambiguous terrain, are continued at an even larger scale.\" In the book, Katniss must deal with betrayal and violence against people. At the same time, while she was symbolically touching thousands of lives, she must also lead those people into war. Finally, Katniss realizes she cannot even trust President Coin, leader of District 13.[10]In an interview with Collins, it was noted that the series \"tackles issues like severe poverty, starvation, oppression, and the effects of war.\" Collins replied that this inspiration was from her father, who, when going to war in Vietnam, made sure that his children understood the consequences and effects of war.[4] Yvonne Zipp of The Christian Science Monitor noted that it was \"the most brutal of the trilogy\" and that \"Collins doesn't take war lightly – her characters debate the morality involved in tactics used to try to overthrow the rotting, immoral government, and they pay a high cost for those tactics.\"[11] Katie Roiphe of The New York Times wrote that \"it is the perfect teenage story with its exquisitely refined rage against the cruel and arbitrary power of the adult world.\"[12] In a review for USA Today, Bob Minzesheimer pointed out that the novel contained optimism: \"Hope emerges from despair. Even in a dystopian future, there's a better future.\"[13]Minzesheimer also noted a central question of \"Real or not real?\" which was asked throughout the novel by Peeta.[13]Susan Carpenter of the Los Angeles Times also pointed this out, writing, \"Mockingjay takes readers into new territories and an even more brutal and confusing world: one where it's unclear what sides the characters are on, one where presumed loyalties are repeatedly stood on their head\".[14]Mockingjay was first released in the US and Canada on August 24, 2010. The UK, New Zealand and Australia received the book one day later, on August 25, 2010. The audiobook was released simultaneously on August 24, 2010, by Scholastic Audio.[8]Sales\n[edit]The book had a 1.2 million-copy first printing that was bumped up from 750,000.[15] In its first week of release, the book sold over 450,000 copies. Following this, Scholastic printed an additional 400,000 copies, bringing the initial print run up to 1.6 million. Scholastic Trade president Ellie Berger said that sales \"have exceeded all expectations\".[16] The book has also been released in e-book format and topped sales in the week ending with August 29, 2010, beating out The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which had held the top spot since April.[17] The other Hunger Games books have also made it in the top ten, with the first book at fifth and the second book taking eighth.[17] As of March 2012[update], the book has sold over 9 million copies.[18]Promotion\n[edit]To promote the release of Mockingjay, many bookstores held midnight release parties. The official event in New York City was attended by Collins, and included many activities such as a tarot card reader, a magician, jugglers and face-painters. Prizes such as signed copies of Catching Fire and Hunger Games-themed cups were raffled. Once Collins arrived, she read the first chapter of the novel, explaining that she would read with an accent since Katniss, the narrator, is from Appalachia. By midnight, copies were being sold with a signature stamp since Collins had a hand injury and was unable to sign.[19]Before the release, Scholastic also released a trailer for the book, launched a Facebook page that gained over 22,000 fans in 10 days, and held a contest for booksellers to win a visit from Collins and an online countdown clock to the release date. There were also advertisements for the book on websites such as Entertainment Weekly and Romantic Times. National Entertainment Collectibles Association also sold other goods such as T-shirts, posters, games and bracelets.[20] Collins also held a \"13-District Blog Tour\" where 13 winners received a free copy of Mockingjay on August 24, 2010.[21] A tour was also scheduled, starting at Books of Wonder in New York where the official party took place. The tour ended on November 6, 2010, in the Third Place Books store in Lake Forest Park, Washington.[22]Critical reception\n[edit]Publishers Weekly gave the book a starred review, calling it \"the best yet, a beautifully orchestrated and intelligent novel that succeeds on every level\". The review went on to praise the \"sharp social commentary and the nifty world building\".[23] Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly gave the book a B+ and said, \"Collins has kicked the brutal violence up a notch in an edge-of-your-seat plot\".[24]Kirkus Reviews gave Mockingjay a starred review, saying that the novel is exactly what its fans are looking for and that \"it will grab them and not let go\".[25]Susan Carpenter of the Los Angeles Times compared the battlefield to Iraq and said that the book is every bit as original as the first in the series, ending the review with \"Wow\".[14]The Baltimore Sun's Nancy Knight commented that the book \"ends on an ostensibly happy note, but the heartbreaking effects of war and loss aren't sugar-coated\" and that it will have readers thinking about the effects of war on society.[10] Katie Roiphe of The New York Times said it is \"the perfect teenage story with its exquisitely refined rage against the cruel and arbitrary power of the adult world\". However, she criticized that it was not as \"impeccably plotted\" as The Hunger Games.[12] Bob Minzesheimer of USA Today gave the book three out of four stars.[13]The Christian Science Monitor reviewer Yvonne Zipp described it as \"an entirely gripping read\".[11]Some critics noted that there was a suspense drop between Catching Fire and the start of Mockingjay. While a review from The Sacramento Bee praised the action scenes and the battle in the Capitol, the reviewer also criticized Collins for not giving enough time to finish all the loose ends, writing that \"the disappointment with Mockingjay hits primarily as Collins starts her home stretch. It's almost as if she didn't allocate enough time or chapters to handle all her threads\".[26]Main articles: The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2The Hunger Games trilogy was adapted into a series of films, with the stars of the 2012 film The Hunger Games signed on for all four films.[27]Mockingjay was split into two parts; Part 1 was released on November 21, 2014, and Part 2 was released on November 20, 2015.[28]Francis Lawrence, director of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, returned to direct the two final films in the series.[29]Julianne Moore played President Coin.[30]^ \"Mockingjay proves the Hunger Games is must-read literature\". io9.

{"title":"Kitchen","author":null,"published":1988,"fiction":true,"plot":"From Mikage's love of kitchens to her job as a culinary teacher's assistant to the multiple scenes in which food is merely present, Kitchen is a short window into the life of a young Japanese woman and her discoveries about food and love amongst a background of tragedy.In Kitchen, a young Japanese woman named Mikage Sakurai struggles to overcome the death of her grandmother. She gradually grows close to one of her grandmother's friends, Yuichi, from a flower shop and ends up staying with him and his transgender mother, Eriko. During her stay, she develops affection for Yuichi and Eriko, almost becoming part of their family. However, she moves out after six months as she finds a new job as a culinary teacher's assistant. When she finds that Eriko was murdered, she tries to support Yuichi through the difficult time, and realises that Yuichi is probably in love with her. Reluctant to face her own feelings for him, she goes away to Izu for a work assignment, while Yuichi stays in a guest-house. However, after going to a restaurant to eat katsudon, she realises she wants to bring it to Yuichi. She goes to Yuichi’s guest-house and sneaks inside his room in the middle of the night to bring him katsudon. There Mikage tells him she doesn’t want to lose him and proposes to build a new life together.In Moonlight Shadow, a woman named Satsuki loses her boyfriend Hitoshi in an accident and tells us: \"The night he died my soul went away to some other place and I couldn't bring it back\". She becomes friendly with his brother Hiiragi, whose girlfriend died in the same crash. On one insomniac night out walking she meets a strange woman called Urara who has also lost someone. Urara introduces her to the mystical experience of The Weaver Festival Phenomenon, which she hopes will cauterize their collective grief.Kirkus Reviews lauded the novella's \"Timeless emotions, elegantly evoked with impressive originality and strength.\"[1]Michiko Kakutani, writing for The New York Times, stated that Yoshimoto demonstrated \"wit\", \"clarity of observation\", and \"firm control of her story\", specifically lauding her \"wonderful tactile ability to convey a mood or a sensation through her descriptions of light and sound and touch, as well as an effortless ability to penetrate her characters' hearts.\" Furthermore, Kakutani said that \"There is a pleasing directness to her writing, and while this sincerity can occasionally result in sentimentality, it more often than not seizes hold of the reader's sympathy and refuses to let go.\"[2]Regarding the inclusion of Moonlight Shadow with Kitchen, however, Kakutani criticized the editorial decision: \"Its noisy echoes of that other novella—the same themes, emotions and even motifs all appear here—feel repetitious and cloying, and they distract the reader from this generously gifted young writer's achievement.\"Kitchen (English edition) by Banana Yoshimoto^ KITCHEN | Kirkus Reviews.\n^ Kakutani, Michiko (12 January 1993). \"Books of The Times; Very Japanese, Very American and Very Popular\".

{"title":"Jaws","author":"Peter Benchley","published":1974,"fiction":true,"plot":"Jaws is set in the fictional town of Amity, a small, seaside resort located on the south shore of Long Island, halfway between Bridgehampton and East Hampton. One night, after making love with a man on the beach, a young woman named Christine Watkins skinny dips alone in the ocean where she is attacked and killed by a massive great white shark. The next morning, her partially eaten remains are found washed up on the beach and the coroner concludes she was the victim of a shark attack. Amity Police Chief Martin Brody then orders the beaches closed, but he is overruled by mayor Larry Vaughan and the town's selectmen who fear damage to summer tourism, Amity's main source of commerce. With the collusion of Harry Meadows, editor of the local newspaper, news of the attack is kept quiet.A few days later, the shark kills a young boy and an elderly man within half an hour of each other. Amity hires Ben Gardner, a local fisherman, to catch the shark, but Ben disappears at sea. Brody and his deputy, Leonard Hendricks, discover Gardner's deserted boat anchored off-shore, covered with large bite holes, one of which has a large shark tooth stuck in it. The boy's mother and Gardner's widow angrily blame the deaths on Brody for not closing the beaches after they learn of the earlier attack on Christine Watkins. Brody, struggling with guilt, orders the beaches closed and has Meadows investigate Vaughan's business affairs to find out why he is so determined to keep them open. Meadows soon discovers the mayor is heavily in debt to the Mafia, who are pressuring Vaughan to keep the beaches open in order to protect the value of Amity's real estate in which the mob has invested a great deal of money; Vaughan stands to lose everything if Amity's home market value should fall. Meadows also recruits Matt Hooper, a young ichthyologist from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for help on dealing with the shark. When shown the tooth found on Gardner's boat, Hooper determines it to be the tooth of an unusually large great white shark.Meanwhile, Brody's wife, Ellen, is lamenting the loss of her youth and the affluent lifestyle she had before marrying Brody and having children. Coincidentally, when Ellen was a teenager, she dated Hooper's older brother a few years before she met Brody. Ellen becomes fixated on Hooper as a link to the past she desperately longs for. After Hooper attends a dinner party at the Brody's, Ellen, intent on recapturing her juvenescence and joie de vivre, decides to seduce him. The following morning, she telephones Hooper at his hotel and invites him to meet her for lunch at a restaurant several miles away from Amity. During lunch, the two have several drinks, begin flirting and after a sexually charged conversation, go to a motel. Unable to reach Hooper nor Ellen by phone that afternoon, Brody begins to suspect they have had a liaison and he becomes obsessed and tormented by the thought.After a week and no further attacks or sightings of the shark, Mayor Vaughan convinces Brody to reopen the beaches. By this time, news of the shark attacks have spread; tourists and news reporters flock to Amity for a glimpse of the killer shark. Brody sets up patrols along the beaches to watch for the fish. After a teenage boy narrowly escapes another attack near the shore, Brody again closes the beaches and convinces the town's selectmen to hire Quint, an eccentric, crusty professional fisherman, to find and kill the shark. Brody and Hooper set out with Quint on his vessel, the Orca and the tension between the three men soon escalates. Brody and Quint both regard Hooper as a conceited, rich kid; Hooper is angry over Quint's methods when he disembowels a blue shark and uses an illegally caught unborn baby dolphin as bait. Brody's suspicions about Hooper and Ellen increase, as more circumstantial evidence points to a possible liaison between them.The first day at sea is unproductive, but the three come in contact with the shark by the end of the second day. Upon seeing the fish for the first time and estimating the shark to be at least 20 ft (6.1 m) in length and weighing in at roughly 5,000 lb (2,300 kg), Hooper is visibly excited and in awe at the size of it.Larry Vaughan visits the Brody house and informs Ellen that he and his wife are leaving Amity. Vaughan speculates on the life he might have led had he married Ellen. After he leaves, Ellen reflects on her life and she realizes the mistake she made missing the life she had before marrying Brody. When Brody returns home a short time later, Ellen kisses him passionately.On the third day, Hooper wants to bring along a shark-proof cage, in an attempt to kill the fish with a bang stick. Initially, Quint refuses to bring the cage on board, considering it a suicidal idea, but he relents after Hooper pays him $100. Brody tells Quint he will not be paid if he brings the cage on board which angers Hooper and a heated argument between Brody and Hooper ensues. Unable to control his temper, Brody physically attacks Hooper and strangles him for several seconds. After several unsuccessful attempts by Quint to harpoon the shark, Hooper goes underwater in the shark cage. The shark attacks the cage, something Hooper did not expect. After destroying the cage, the shark kills and eats Hooper. Brody is horrified and is now convinced the shark can't be killed. He tells Quint that after Hooper's death the town may no longer pay him, but Quint is now determined to kill the shark regardless of the money.Quint and Brody return to sea the next day. After the shark attacks the Orca and Quint harpoons it several more times, the fish leaps out of the water and onto the stern of the boat, smashing the transom. The Orca begins to sink and Quint plunges another harpoon into the shark's belly. As the fish settles back into the water, Quint's foot becomes entangled in the rope attached to the harpoon and he is pulled underwater and drowns. Brody, now staying afloat on a seat cushion, watches the shark slowly swim towards him; he closes his eyes and prepares for death. Just as the shark reaches Brody, it succumbs to its wounds and dies before it can attack. Slowly, the shark begins to sink. The lone survivor of the ordeal, Brody watches the dead shark spiral downward and disappear into the depths; he then begins to paddle back to shore on his makeshift float.Peter Benchley had long been fascinated with sharks, which he frequently encountered while fishing in Nantucket with his father, Nathaniel Benchley.[2] For years, he had considered writing \"a story about a shark that attacks people and what would happen if it came in and wouldn't go away.\"[3] This interest grew greater after reading a 1964 news story about fisherman Frank Mundus catching a great white shark weighing 4,550 pounds (2,060 kg) off the shore of Montauk, New York.[4][5]In 1971, Benchley was a freelance writer, struggling to support his wife and children.[6] In the meantime, his literary agent scheduled regular meetings with publishing house editors.[2] One was Doubleday editor Thomas Congdon, who met with Benchley seeking book ideas. Congdon did not find Benchley's proposals for non-fiction interesting, but instead favored his idea for a novel about a shark terrorizing a beach resort. Benchley sent an outline page to Congdon's office, and the editor paid him $1,000 for 100 pages.[4] These pages comprised the first four chapters, and the full manuscript received a $7,500 total advance (equivalent to $58,231 in 2024).[2]Congdon and the Doubleday crew were confident, seeing Benchley as \"something of an expert in sharks\",[7] given the author self-described \"knowing as much as any amateur about sharks\" as he had read some research books and seen the 1971 documentary Blue Water White Death.[2] After Doubleday commissioned the book, Benchley then started researching all possible material regarding sharks. Among his sources were Peter Matthiessen's Blue Meridian, Jacques Cousteau's The Shark: Splendid Savage of the Sea, Thomas B. Allen's Shadows in the Sea, and David H. Davies' About Sharks and Shark Attacks.[8][9]Benchley procrastinated finishing the novel and only began writing in earnest once his agent reminded him that if he did not deliver the manuscript, he would have to return the $7,500 writer's advance. As this money had long been spent, Benchley had no choice. His hastily written first-draft partial manuscript was derided by Congdon, who did not like its comic tone.[2] Congdon only approved the first five pages, which made it into the published book without any revisions, and asked Benchley to follow the tone of that introduction.[4] A month later, Benchley delivered a broader outline of the story and rewritten chapters to which Congdon gave his approval.The manuscript took Benchley a year and a half to complete.[8] Benchley worked on the novel in a makeshift office above a furnace company in Pennington, New Jersey during the winter months. In the summer, he moved to a converted turkey coop on the seaside property of his in-laws in Stonington, Connecticut.[6] Congdon dictated some changes to the rest of the book, including a sex scene between Brody and Ellen which was later changed to Ellen and Hooper. Congdon did not feel that there was \"any place for this wholesome marital sex in this kind of book\". After various rewrites, revisions, edits and sporadic advance payments, Benchley delivered his final draft of the untitled manuscript in January, 1973.[7]Title and cover\n[edit]Shortly before the book went to press, Benchley had still not chosen a title. Benchley had many working titles during development, many of which he called \"pretentious\", such as The Stillness in the Water and Leviathan Rising. Benchley regarded other ideas, such as The Jaws of Death and The Jaws of Leviathan, as \"melodramatic, weird or pretentious\".[3] Congdon and Benchley brainstormed about the title frequently, with the writer estimating about 125 ideas raised.[8] The novel still did not have a title until twenty minutes before production of the book. The writer discussed the problem with editor Tom Congdon at a restaurant in New York:For the cover, Benchley wanted an illustration of Amity as seen through the jaws of a shark.[7] Doubleday's design director, Alex Gotfryd, assigned book illustrator Wendell Minor with the task.[10] The image was eventually vetoed for sexual overtones, compared by sales managers to the vagina dentata. Congdon and Gotfryd eventually settled on printing a typographical jacket, but that was subsequently discarded once Bantam editor Oscar Dystel noted the title Jaws was so vague \"it could have been a title about dentistry\".[7] Gotfryd tried to get Minor to do a new cover, but he was out of town, so he instead turned to artist Paul Bacon.[10] Bacon drew an enormous shark head, and Gotfryd suggested adding a swimmer \"to have a sense of disaster and a sense of scale\". The subsequent drawing became the eventual hardcover art, with a shark head rising towards a swimming woman.[7]Despite the acceptance of the Bacon cover by Doubleday, Dystel did not like the cover, and assigned New York illustrator Roger Kastel to do a different one for the paperback. Following Bacon's basic concept, Kastel illustrated his favorite part of the novel, the opening where the shark attacks Christine Watkins. For research, Kastel went to the American Museum of Natural History, and took advantage of the shark exhibits being closed for cleaning to photograph the models. The photographs then provided reference for a \"ferocious-looking shark that was still realistic.\"[10] In actuality, the stuffed shark Kastel chose for his reference was not a great white shark, but a mako shark. [11] After painting the shark, Kastel did the female swimmer. Following a photoshoot for Good Housekeeping, Kastel requested the model he was photographing to lie on a stool in the approximate position of a front crawl.[12] The oil-on-board painting Kastel created for the cover would eventually be reused by Universal Pictures for the film posters and advertising, albeit slightly bowdlerized with the woman's naked body partially obscured with more sea foam. The original painting of the cover was stolen and has never been recovered, leaving Bacon to speculate that some Hollywood executive now has it.[10]The story of Jaws is limited by how the humans respond to the shark menace.[13] Much detail is given to the shark, with descriptions of its anatomy and presence creating the sense of an awesome, unstoppable threat.[14] Elevating the menace are violent descriptions of the shark attacks.[15] Along with a carnivorous killer on the sea, Amity is populated with equally predatory humans: the mayor who has ties with the Mafia, a depressed, adulterous housewife and criminals among the tourists.[16]The novel contained 1970s cultural themes of a frayed marriage, a financially strapped town and distrust of the local government, in an era when divorces were on the rise, unemployment was high, and the political scandals of President Nixon and others had eroded the public's trust .[17]In the meantime, the impact of the predatory deaths resemble Henrik Ibsen's play An Enemy of the People, with the mayor of a small town panicking over how a problem will drive away the tourists.[13] Another source of comparison raised by critics was Moby-Dick, particularly regarding Quint's characterization and the ending featuring a confrontation with the shark; Quint even dies the same way as Captain Ahab.[18][19][20] The central character, Chief Brody, fits a common characterization of the disaster genre, an authority figure who is forced to provide guidance to those affected by the sudden tragedy.[13] Focusing on a working class local leads the book's prose to describe the beachgoers with contempt, and Brody to have conflicts with the rich outsider Hooper.[14]\"I knew that Jaws couldn't possibly be successful. It was a first novel, and nobody reads first novels. It was a first novel about a fish, so who cares?\"\n\n–Peter Benchley[3]Benchley said that neither he nor anyone else involved in Jaws conception initially realized the book's potential. Tom Congdon, however, sensed that the novel had prospects and had it sent to the Book of the Month Club and paperback original houses. The Book of the Month Club made it an \"A\" book, qualifying it for its main selection. Reader's Digest Condensed Books also selected it (removing the adult themes and language). The publication date was moved back to allow a carefully orchestrated release. It was released first in hardcover in February 1974,[1] then in the book clubs, followed by a national campaign for the paperback release.[21]Bantam bought the paperback rights for $575,000,[1] which Benchley points out was \"then an enormous sum of money\".[3] After Bantam's rights expired years later, they reverted to Benchley, who subsequently sold the rights to Random House, who has since published all the reprints of Jaws.[8]Upon release, Jaws became a great success. According to John Baxter's biography of Steven Spielberg, the novel's first entry on California's best-seller list was caused by Spielberg and producers Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown, who were on pre-production for the Jaws film, buying a hundred copies of the novel each, most of which were sent to \"opinion-makers and members of the chattering class\".[1]Jaws was the state's most successful book by 7 p.m. on the first day. However, sales were good nationwide without engineering.[1] The hardcover stayed on The New York Times bestseller list for 44 weeks – peaking at number two behind Watership Down – selling a total of 125,000 copies. The paperback version was even more successful, topping book charts worldwide,[22] and by the time the film adaptation debuted in June, 1975, the novel had sold 5.5 million copies domestically,[23] a number that eventually reached 9.5 million copies.[1] Worldwide sales are estimated at 20 million copies.[24] The success inspired ABC to invite Benchley for an episode of The American Sportsman, where the writer swam with sharks in Australia, in what would be the first of many nature-related television programs Benchley would take part in.[8]Audio adaptations\n[edit]A 6-part abridged adaptation read by John Guerrasio was broadcast on BBC Radio 7 in 2008.[25] A 10-part abridged adaptation read by Henry Goodman was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2018 as part of its Book at Bedtime program.[26]An unabridged audio adaptation read by Erik Steele was released by Blackstone Audio in both CD and downloadable format in 2009. A French translation, Les Dents de la Mer, read by Pascal Casanova was released exclusively by Audible Studios in downloadable format in 2018.[27]Despite the enormous commercial success of Jaws, reviews of the novel were mixed. The most common criticism focused on the human characters. Michael A. Rogers of Rolling Stone declared that \"None of the humans are particularly likable or interesting\" and confessed the shark was his favorite character, \"and one suspects Benchley's also.\"[28] Steven Spielberg shared the sentiment, saying he initially found many of the characters unsympathetic and wanted the shark to \"win\", a characterization he changed in the film adaptation.[4]Critics also derided Benchley's writing. Time reviewer John Skow described the novel as \"cliché and crude literary calculation\", where events \"refuse to take on life and momentum\" and the climax \"lacks only Queequeg's coffin to resemble a bath tub version of Moby-Dick.\"[19] Writing for The Village Voice, Donald Newlove declared that \"Jaws has rubber teeth for a plot. It's boring, pointless, listless; if there's a trite turn to make, Jaws will make that turn.\"[29] An article in The Listener criticized the plot, stating the \"novel only has bite, so to say, at feed time,\" and these scenes are \"naïve attempts at whipping along a flagging story-line.\"[30]Andrew Bergman of The New York Times Book Review felt that despite the book serving as \"fluid entertainment\", \"passages of hollow portentousness creep in\" while poor scene \"connections [and] stark manipulations impair the narrative.\"[31]Some reviewers found Jaws's description of the shark attacks entertaining. John Spurling of the New Statesman asserted that while the \"characterisation of the humans is fairly rudimentary\", the shark \"is done with exhilarating and alarming skill, and every scene in which it appears is imagined at a special pitch of intensity.\"[32] Christopher Lehmann-Haupt praised the novel in a short review for The New York Times, highlighting the \"strong plot\" and \"rich thematic substructure.\"[33]The Washington Post's Robert F. Jones described Jaws as \"much more than a gripping fish story. It is a tightly written, tautly paced study,\" which \"forged and touched a metaphor that still makes us tingle whenever we enter the water.\"[34]New York reviewer Eliot Fremont-Smith found the novel \"immensely readable\" despite the lack of \"memorable characters or much plot surprise or originality\"; Fremont-Smith wrote that Benchley \"fulfills all expectations, provides just enough civics and ecology to make us feel good, and tops it off with a really terrific and grisly battle scene\".[20]In the years following publication, Benchley began to feel responsible for the negative attitudes against sharks that his novel engendered. He became an ardent ocean conservationist.[4] In an article for the National Geographic published in 2000, Benchley writes \"considering the knowledge accumulated about sharks in the last 25 years, I couldn't possibly write Jaws today ... not in good conscience anyway. Back then, it was generally accepted that great whites were anthropophagus (they ate people) by choice. Now we know that almost every shark attack on a human is an accident: A shark mistakes a human for its normal prey.\"[35] Upon his death in 2006, Benchley's widow Wendy declared the author \"kept telling people the book was fiction\", and comparing Jaws to The Godfather, \"he took no more responsibility for the fear of sharks than Mario Puzo took responsibility for the Mafia.\"[18]Main article: Jaws (film)Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown, film producers at Universal Pictures, both heard about the book before publication at the same time. Upon reading it, both agreed the novel was exciting and deserved a feature film adaptation, even if they were unsure how to accomplish it.[3] Benchley's agent sold the adaptation rights for $150,000, plus an extra $25,000 for Benchley to write the screenplay.[7] Although this delighted the author, who had very little money at the time,[3] it was a comparatively low sum, as the agreement occurred before the book became a surprise bestseller.[36] After securing the rights, Steven Spielberg, who was making his first theatrical film, The Sugarland Express, for Zanuck, Brown and Universal, was hired as the director.[37] To play the protagonists, the producers cast Robert Shaw as Quint, Roy Scheider as Brody and Richard Dreyfuss as Hooper.[38]Benchley's contract promised him the first draft of the Jaws screenplay. He wrote three drafts before passing the job over to other writers;[36] the screenplay is credited to Benchley and actor-writer Carl Gottlieb who wrote the majority of the final script and appears in the film in the small role of newspaper editor Harry Meadows.[38] Benchley also has a cameo role in the film, playing a TV news reporter.[39] For the film adaptation, Spielberg wanted to preserve the novel's basic concept while removing Benchley's subplots and altering the characterizations, having found all of the characters of the book unlikable.[36] Among the film's notable differences from the novel are the omission of the adulterous affair between Ellen Brody and Matt Hooper and Mayor Larry Vaughn's connections to the mafia. Harry Meadows, a major character in the novel, is reduced to a peripheral character in the film; several other characters from the novel do not appear in the film.[40] In the novel, it is implied that Quint may be a former Marine; in the film, he became a survivor of the World War II USS Indianapolis disaster.[41] In the novel, Hooper, in the shark cage, is killed by the shark but in the film, he survives. In the film, Quint is killed and eaten by the shark; in the novel, he accidentally drowns. The shark's death is caused by a scuba tank explosion in the film, rather than the extensive wounds from Quint's harpoon, as in the novel.[42] Spielberg estimated the final script had a total of 27 scenes that were not in the book.[40] The location of Amity was also changed; while scouting the book's Long Island setting, Brown found it \"too grand\" and not fitting the idea of \"a vacation area that was lower middle class enough so that an appearance of a shark would destroy the tourist business.\" Thus, Amity was changed from a coastal town on Long Island, to a small island in New England (filmed on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts).[43]Released in theaters in 1975, Jaws became the highest-grossing film ever at the time, a record it held for two years until the release of Star Wars.[44][45] Benchley was satisfied with the adaptation, noting how dropping the subplots allowed for \"all the little details that fleshed out the characters\".[8] The film's success led to three sequels, with which Benchley had no involvement despite them drawing on his characters.[46] According to Benchley, once when his payment of the adaptation-related royalties didn't arrive as expected, he called his agent and she informed him that the studio was arranging a deal for sequels. Benchley disliked the idea, saying, \"I don't care about sequels; who'll ever want to make a sequel to a movie about a fish?\" He subsequently chose a one-time payment of $70,000 for each of the three sequels, relinquishing continuing royalties for future sequels.[8]^ a b c d e f Baxter 1997, p. 120.\n^ a b c d e Benchley 2006, pp. 14–17.\n^ a b c d e f g .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}Bouzereau, Laurent (1995). \"A Look Inside Jaws: From Novel to Script\".

{"title":"Love You Forever","author":"Robert Munsch","published":1986,"fiction":true,"plot":"The story details the cycle of life by chronicling the experiences of a young son and his mother throughout the course of the boy's life and describing the frustrating behavior exhibited by him throughout his youth.Despite her occasional aggravation caused by her son's behavior at two years old, nine years old, and as a teenager, the mother nonetheless visits his bedroom nightly to cradle him in her arms, and sing a brief lullaby promising to always love him:I'll love you foreverI'll like you for alwaysAs long as I'm livingMy baby you'll beAfter her son grows up and moves across town, his mother occasionally sneaks into his bedroom at night to croon her customary lullaby.However, the mother gradually grows old and frail, and her grown son visits his feeble, sickly mother for the final time.When the son first arrives, his mother tries to sing her lullaby to him, but she is too weak to finish. The son then cradles his mother in his arms and sings the lullaby for her in reciprocation for the unconditional love that his mother had shown him throughout his life, changing the last line to \"My Mommy you'll be.\"After returning home, the son pauses at the top of the stairs for a long moment (perhaps grieving the death of his mother). He then goes into the nursery, cradles his newborn daughter, and sings his mother's signature lullaby for her, implying that the cycle will continue.The book was written after Munsch and his wife had two stillborn babies.[1] It began as a song that Munsch would sing in his head for his two babies as singing it out loud was too emotional. During a performance at a theatre in the University of Guelph, the short song turned into a full story that was later published as a book. [2]Munsch and his wife have since adopted three children.[3]Love You Forever was listed fourth on the 2001 Publishers Weekly All-Time Bestselling Children's Books list for paperbacks at 6,970,000 copies (not including the 1,049,000 hardcover copies).[4] In 2001, Maria Shriver wrote in O, The Oprah Magazine: \"I have yet to read this book through without crying. It says so much about the circle of life, youth, parenting, and our responsibility for our parents as we grow older. The message is so simple yet so profound. Love You Forever is a great gift for anyone with a child, or even for your own parents.\"[5] Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children.\"[6]Some readers dislike the portion of the story where the mother sneaks into her grown son's home. One Publishers Weekly reviewer states that Love You Forever is a divisive children's book. \"Either it moves you to tears and you love it, or it makes your skin crawl and you detest it...\"[7] A commentator wrote \"it's either a touching account of a mother's unending love or the ultimate helicopter parenting gone bad.\"[8]In 2020, playwright Topher Payne released an alternate ending for the book, which he titled Love You Forever & I'll Call Before I Come Over, with art in the style of the original. In Payne's version, the son installs security bars on his windows; he subsequently explains to his mother that although he still loves her, he also needs personal space. Payne subsequently stated that \"taken as metaphor, Love You Forever is beautiful, a mother's devotion. Taken literally, the mother is a little nuts.\" [9]The book is prominently featured in the Friends episode \"The One with the Cake\". In the episode, Joey performs a dramatic reading of the book at Emma's first birthday (as he had forgotten to get a present and saw the book nearby), moving everyone to tears. Joey later realizes that he has forgotten to prepare for an upcoming audition and decides to recite the book as a dramatic monologue.^ BabyCenter. \"Truth Behind Love You Forever\". Mom.

{"title":"The Women's Room","author":"Marilyn French","published":1977,"fiction":true,"plot":"Mira and her friends represent a wide cross-section of American society in the 1950s and 1960s. Mira herself is from a middle-class background. She is mildly rebellious in that she disagrees with her mother's view of the world. In her late teens she dates a fellow student named Lanny; one night, when she was supposed to be out on a date with him, Lanny ignores her, and in response Mira dances with several men. Mira's actions in this instance gain her a reputation for being loose. Through this experience and several others with Lanny, Mira realizes she does not want to marry him because he would leave her at home, alone, scrubbing floors.Later, Mira marries Norm, a future doctor. Mira and Norm have two sons, Norm, Jr. (referred to as Normie throughout the book) and Clark. During the first few years of her marriage, Mira develops friendships with three neighborhood women: Natalie, Adele, and Bliss—all of whom are married with children. The women begin to throw dinner parties in order to create fun evenings together that involve their husbands. At the dinner parties there is flirtation among the different couples. Natalie begins to believe that her husband and Mira are having an affair, but Mira is able to dismiss Natalie's accusation, and their bonds survive until Mira discovers that Bliss and Natalie are having affairs with Adele's husband. The suspicion and actuality of affairs within the group results in irreversible damage to their friendships.Mira and Norm later move to the small town of Beau Reve, where Mira meets fellow married women with children: Lily, Samantha, and Martha. During this time Mira's marriage becomes increasingly routine, and Mira finds herself at home, alone, scrubbing floors. Also while in Beau Reve, Mira witnesses her friends' struggles: Lily goes mad as a result of her son's rebellious behavior, Samantha is evicted after her husband loses his job and leaves her, and Martha takes a married lover who simultaneously gets his wife pregnant. Through her friends, Mira begins to understand the unfair advantages enjoyed by men in relationships.After many years of marriage, Norm files for divorce (it is hinted that he has been having an affair for some time) and remarries, leaving Mira on her own. During this time, Mira, lost without her routine life of wifely duties, attempts to commit suicide. She is found by Martha, who helps her pick herself up. Mira returns the help in due time when Martha, too, attempts suicide when trying to deal with her failed affair and resulting divorce.Following her and Norm's divorce, Mira goes to Harvard University to study for a Ph.D. in English literature, with which she hopes to fulfill her lifelong dream of teaching. There she meets Val, a militant radical feminist divorcée with a \"precocious\" teenage daughter, Chris. It is the heyday of Women's Liberation and Mira, now too, finally able to verbalize her discontent at the society around her, becomes a feminist, although a less radical and militant one than Val. Their circle includes Isolde (a lesbian divorcée), Kyla (married to Harley), and Clarissa (married to Duke). It also includes Ben, a diplomat to the fictional African nation of Lianu, with whom Mira begins a relationship.Mira and Ben have a happy relationship, in which Mira is able to maintain a sense of independence. Mira's development in the relationship contributes to her new unwillingness to live the life of a stereotypical housewife. When Mira's children come to visit her at Harvard, her growth and independence is revealed by a clear change in her views on the dichotomy between motherhood and sexuality.While at college, Val's daughter, Chris, is raped. Following Chris' rape, Val states (over Mira's protests), \"Whatever they may be in public life, whatever their relationships with men, in their relationships with women, all men are rapists, and that's all they are. They rape us with their eyes, their laws, and their codes.\"Mira later ends her relationship with Ben, after realizing that he expects her to return to Lianu with him and bear his children. Soon afterward, she discovers that Val has been shot following a violent protest at the trial of a rape victim.The book ends with a brief summary of where the characters are now. Ben married his secretary and now has two children. Mira is teaching at a small community college and is not dating anyone. The ending is also a doubling back in which the narrator begins to write the story the reader has just read.The Women's Room received both praise and criticism. The novel was a New York Times bestseller the year it was released, 1977.[10] In June 2004, a sample of 500 people attending the Guardian Hay Festival included The Women's Room in their list of the top 50 essential contemporary reads, demonstrating that time has not diminished the importance of French's novel,[11] and as of 2009, The Women's Room sold over 20 million copies and was translated into 20 languages.[12]Many women found The Women's Room relatable and stimulating; they were able to recognize their own lives in Mira's.[13]Susan G. Cole remembers \"riding the subway after [The Women's Room] came out in paperback and noticing five women in one car devouring it.\"[14]Susan Faludi viewed the novel as capable of \"[inspiring] an outward-looking passion and commitment in its readers,\" which \"was no small feat.\"[15]Gloria Steinem states that The Women's Room \"expressed the experience of a huge number of women and let them know that they were not alone and not crazy.\"[12]Much of the negative criticism of The Women's Room is based on the lack of dynamic male characters in the book. The failure to have any man in the novel that did not blur together with other male characters allowed negative criticism to home in on the view of an expressed anti-male sentiment, which discredited much of the positive and true portrayal of women in the novel.[16] Ellen Goodman discusses this idea that within The Women's Room, the women are dynamic characters, whereas the male characters lack depth.[17] Christopher Lehmann-Haupt concurs with Goodman and feels that while women may relate to the novel, there is little comfort for men within The Women's Room.[18] Anne Tyler goes a step further than Goodman and Lehmann-Haupt by stating that the entire novel is \"very long and very narrow\" and very biased.[19]Cole said \"critics thought it was hard on men, but the average woman did not.\"[14] French's novel was a turning point for feminist fiction. While non-fiction works, such as The Feminine Mystique, were helping to recruit feminists, feminist fiction was still not widely read and was considered reading for only \"hardcore\" feminists.[14] French's The Women's Room changed that, as shown by its wide reception and New York Times bestseller ranking.[10]^ \"Marilyn French, Novelist and Champion of Feminism Dies at 79\" by A.G.

{"title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn","author":"Mark Twain","published":1884,"fiction":true,"plot":"In 1840s St. Petersburg, Missouri, Huckleberry Finn has received a considerable sum of money following The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and the Widow Douglas and her sister Miss Watson become his guardians. Despite preferring life as an errant boy, Huck stays so he can be part of Tom Sawyer's gang. Huck's father, \"Pap\", an abusive alcoholic, tries to appropriate Huck's fortune. When this fails, Pap imprisons him in a remote cabin.After a delirium tremens crisis in which Pap tries to kill Huck, Huck fakes his own murder and settles on Jackson's Island, where he reunites with Miss Watson's slave Jim, who ran away after overhearing she was planning to sell him. Huck and Jim decide to go down the Mississippi River to Cairo, in the free state of Illinois. After a flood, they find a timber raft and a house floating downstream. Inside the house, Jim finds a man who was shot to death but prevents Huck from seeing.[5] Huck sneaks into town disguised as a girl and discovers from Judith Loftus that there is a reward for Jim's capture and that he is suspected of killing Huck; they flee on their raft.Huck and Jim come across a grounded steamboat on which two thieves discuss murdering a third. Finding their raft has drifted away, they flee in the thieves' boat. They find their raft and sink the thieves' boat, then Huck tricks a night watchman into a rescue attempt, which fails when the steamboat sinks. Huck and Jim are separated in a fog. When they reunite, Huck tricks Jim into thinking he dreamed the event. Jim is disappointed in Huck when Huck admits the truth. Huck is surprised by Jim's strong feelings and apologizes.Huck is conflicted about supporting a runaway slave, but when two white men seeking runaways come upon the raft, his lies convince them to leave. Jim and Huck realize they have passed Cairo. With no way to go upriver, they decide to continue downriver. The raft is struck by a passing steamship, again separating them. On the riverbank, Huck meets the Grangerfords, who are engaged in a 30-year feud with the Shepherdsons. After a Grangerford daughter elopes with a Shepherdson boy, all the Grangerford men are killed in a Shepherdson ambush. Huck escapes and is reunited with Jim, who has found and repaired the raft.Jim and Huck are joined by two confidence men claiming to be a King and a Duke, and they rope Huck and Jim into aiding in several scams. In one town, the King and the Duke cheat the townsfolk over two nights with a short, overpriced stage performance. On the third, the grifters collect the admission fee from previous audience members bent on revenge, then flee. In the next town, the swindlers impersonate the brothers of the recently deceased Peter Wilks and attempt to steal his estate. Huck tries to retrieve the money for Wilks's orphaned nieces. Two other men claiming to be Wilks' brothers arrive, causing an uproar. Huck flees but is caught by the King and the Duke. He escapes but finds they sold Jim to the Phelpses. Huck vows to free Jim, despite believing he will go to hell for it.The Phelpses mistake Huck for their nephew Tom, who is expected for a visit, and Huck plays along. Their nephew is Tom Sawyer; when he arrives he pretends to be his brother Sid and develops a theatrical plan to free Jim. Huck attempts to warn the King and the Duke that Jim alerted local residents to their scam but sees them tarred and feathered and being run out of town on a rail.Tom is wounded during Jim's escape. Instead of fleeing, Jim stays to tend to him and is arrested and returned to the Phelpses.[6] Tom's Aunt Polly arrives and reveals Huck's and Tom's true identities. She explains that Miss Watson has died, and that she freed Jim in her will. Tom admits he knew but wanted to \"rescue\" Jim in style.[7] Jim tells Huck Pap was the dead man in the floating house. Huck declares he will flee to Indian Territory to escape adoption by the Phelpses.See also: List of Tom Sawyer charactersIn order of appearance:Adventures of Huckleberry Finn explores themes of race and identity; what it means to be free and civilized; and the ideas of humanity and social responsibility in the changing landscape of America. A complexity exists concerning Jim's character. While some scholars point out that Jim is good-hearted and moral, and he is not unintelligent (in contrast to several of the more negatively depicted white characters), others have criticized the novel as racist, citing the use of the word \"nigger\" and emphasizing the stereotypically \"comic\" treatment of Jim's lack of education, superstition and ignorance. This argument is supported by incidents early in the novel where Huck deliberately \"tricks\" Jim, taking advantage of his gullibility and Jim still remains loyal to him.[9][10]But this novel is also Huck's 'coming of age' story where he overcomes his initial biases and forms a deeper bond with Jim. Throughout the story, Huck is in moral conflict with the received values of the society in which he lives. Huck is unable consciously to rebut those values even in his thoughts, but he makes a moral choice based on his own valuation of Jim's friendship and human worth, a decision in direct opposition to the things he has been taught. Twain, in his lecture notes, proposes that \"a sound heart is a surer guide than an ill-trained conscience\" and goes on to describe the novel as \"a book of mine where a sound heart and a deformed conscience come into collision and conscience suffers defeat\".[11]To highlight the hypocrisy required to condone slavery within an ostensibly moral system, Twain has Huck's father enslave his son, isolate him and beat him. When Huck escapes, he immediately encounters Jim \"illegally\" doing the same thing. The treatments both of them receive are radically different, especially in an encounter with Mrs. Judith Loftus who takes pity on who she presumes to be a runaway apprentice, Huck, yet boasts about her husband sending the hounds after a runaway slave, Jim.[12]Some scholars discuss Huck's own character, and the novel itself, in the context of its relation to African-American culture as a whole. John Alberti quotes Shelley Fisher Fishkin, who writes in her 1990s book Was Huck Black?: Mark Twain and African-American Voices, \"by limiting their field of inquiry to the periphery, [white scholars] have missed the ways in which African-American voices shaped Twain's creative imagination at its core.\" It is suggested that the character of Huckleberry Finn illustrates the correlation, and even interrelatedness, between white and Black culture in the United States.[13]The original illustrations were done by E. W. Kemble, at the time a young artist working for Life magazine. Kemble was hand-picked by Twain, who admired his work. Hearn suggests that Twain and Kemble had a similar skill, writing that:As Kemble could afford only one model, most of his illustrations produced for the book were done by guesswork. When the novel was published, the illustrations were praised even as the novel was harshly criticized. E.W. Kemble produced another set of illustrations for Harper's and the American Publishing Company in 1898 and 1899 after Twain lost the copyright.[15]Twain initially conceived of the work as a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer that would follow Huckleberry Finn through adulthood. Beginning with a few pages he had removed from the earlier novel, Twain began work on a manuscript he originally titled Huckleberry Finn's Autobiography. Twain worked on the manuscript off and on for the next several years, ultimately abandoning his original plan of following Huck's development into adulthood. He appeared to have lost interest in the manuscript while it was in progress and set it aside for several years. After making a trip down the Hudson River, Twain returned to his work on the novel. Upon completion, the novel's title closely paralleled its predecessor's: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer's Comrade).[16]Mark Twain composed the story in pen on notepaper between 1876 and 1883. Paul Needham, who supervised the authentication of the manuscript for Sotheby's books and manuscripts department in New York in 1991, stated, \"What you see is [Clemens'] attempt to move away from pure literary writing to dialect writing\". For example, Twain revised the opening line of Huck Finn three times. He initially wrote, \"You will not know about me\", which he changed to, \"You do not know about me\", before settling on the final version, \"You don't know about me, without you have read a book by the name of 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'; but that ain't no matter.\"[17] The revisions also show how Twain reworked his material to strengthen the characters of Huck and Jim, as well as his sensitivity to the then-current debate over literacy and voting.[18][19]A later version was the first typewritten manuscript delivered to a printer.[20]Demand for the book spread outside of the United States. Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was eventually published on December 10, 1884, in Canada and the United Kingdom, and on February 18, 1885, in the United States.[21] The illustration on page 283 became a point of issue after an engraver, whose identity was never discovered, made a last-minute addition to the printing plate of Kemble's picture of old Silas Phelps, which drew attention to Phelps' groin. Thirty thousand copies of the book had been printed before the obscenity was discovered. A new plate was made to correct the illustration and repair the existing copies.[22][23]In 1885, the Buffalo Public Library's curator, James Fraser Gluck, approached Twain to donate the manuscript to the library. Twain did so. Later it was believed that half of the pages had been misplaced by the printer. In 1991, the missing first half turned up in a steamer trunk owned by descendants of Gluck's. The library successfully claimed possession and, in 1994, opened the Mark Twain Room to showcase the treasure.[24]In relation to the literary climate at the time of the book's publication in 1885, Henry Nash Smith describes the importance of Mark Twain's already established reputation as a \"professional humorist\", having already published over a dozen other works. Smith suggests that while the \"dismantling of the decadent Romanticism of the later nineteenth century was a necessary operation,\" Adventures of Huckleberry Finn illustrated \"previously inaccessible resources of imaginative power, but also made vernacular language, with its new sources of pleasure and new energy, available for American prose and poetry in the twentieth century.\"[25]While it is clear that Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was controversial from the outset, Norman Mailer, writing in The New York Times in 1984, concluded that Twain's novel was not initially \"too unpleasantly regarded.\" In fact, Mailer writes: \"the critical climate could hardly anticipate T. S. Eliot and Ernest Hemingway's encomiums 50 years later,\" reviews that would remain longstanding in the American consciousness.[26]Alberti suggests that the academic establishment responded to the book's challenges both dismissively and with confusion. During Twain's time and today, defenders of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn \"lump all nonacademic critics of the book together as extremists and 'censors', thus equating the complaints about the book's 'coarseness' from the genteel bourgeois trustees of the Concord Public Library in the 1880s with more recent objections based on race and civil rights.\"[13]Upon issue of the American edition in 1885, several libraries banned it from their shelves.[27] The early criticism focused on what was perceived as the book's crudeness. One incident was recounted in the newspaper the Boston Transcript:Writer Louisa May Alcott criticized the book's publication as well, saying that if Twain \"[could not] think of something better to tell our pure-minded lads and lasses he had best stop writing for them\".[29][30]In 1905, New York's Brooklyn Public Library also banned the book due to \"bad word choice\" and Huck's having \"not only itched but scratched\" within the novel, which was considered obscene. When asked by a Brooklyn librarian about the situation, Twain sardonically replied:Many subsequent critics, Ernest Hemingway among them, have deprecated the final chapters, claiming the book \"devolves into little more than minstrel-show satire and broad comedy\" after Jim is detained.[33] Although Hemingway declared, \"All modern American literature comes from\" Huck Finn, and hailed it as \"the best book we've had\", he cautioned, \"If you must read it you must stop where the Nigger Jim is stolen from the boys. That is the real end. The rest is just cheating.\"[34][35] The African-American writer Ralph Ellison argued that \"Hemingway completely missed the structural, symbolic and moral necessity for that part of the plot in which the boys rescue Jim. Yet it is precisely this part which gives the novel its significance.\"[36]Pulitzer Prize winner Ron Powers states in his Twain biography (Mark Twain: A Life) that \"Huckleberry Finn endures as a consensus masterpiece despite these final chapters\", in which Tom Sawyer leads Huck through elaborate machinations to rescue Jim.[37]In his introduction to The Annotated Huckleberry Finn, Michael Patrick Hearn writes that Twain \"could be uninhibitedly vulgar\", and quotes critic William Dean Howells, a Twain contemporary, who wrote that the author's \"humor was not for most women\". However, Hearn continues by explaining that \"the reticent Howells found nothing in the proofs of Huckleberry Finn so offensive that it needed to be struck out\".[38]Racial stereotyping\n[edit]Much of modern scholarship of Huckleberry Finn has focused on its treatment of race. Many Twain scholars have argued that the book, by humanizing Jim and exposing the fallacies of the racist assumptions of slavery, is an attack on racism.[39] Others have argued that the book falls short on this score, especially in its depiction of Jim.[27] According to Professor Stephen Railton of the University of Virginia, Twain was unable to fully rise above the stereotypes of Black people that White readers of his era expected and enjoyed, and, therefore, resorted to minstrel show-style comedy to provide humor at Jim's expense, and ended up confirming rather than challenging late 19th-century racist stereotypes.[40]In one instance, the controversy caused a drastically altered interpretation of the text: in 1955, CBS tried to avoid controversial material in a televised version of the book, by deleting all mention of slavery and omitting the character of Jim entirely.[41]Use of the word \"nigger\"\n[edit]Because of this controversy over whether Huckleberry Finn is racist or anti-racist, and because the word \"nigger\" is frequently used in the novel (a commonly used word in Twain's time that has since become vulgar and taboo), many have questioned the appropriateness of teaching the book in the U.S. public school system—this questioning of the word \"nigger\" is illustrated by a school administrator of Virginia in 1982 calling the novel the \"most grotesque example of racism I've ever seen in my life\".[42] According to the American Library Association, Huckleberry Finn was the fifth-most frequently challenged book in the United States during the 1990s.[43]There have been several more recent cases involving protests for the banning of the novel. In 2003, high school student Calista Phair and her grandmother, Beatrice Clark, in Renton, Washington, proposed banning the book from classroom learning in the Renton School District, though not from any public libraries, because of the word \"nigger\". The two curriculum committees that considered her request eventually decided to keep the novel on the 11th grade curriculum, though they suspended it until a panel had time to review the novel and set a specific teaching procedure for the novel's controversial topics.[44]In 2009, a white Washington state high school teacher, John Foley, called for replacing Adventures of Huckleberry Finn with a more modern novel.[45] In an opinion column that Foley wrote in the Seattle Post Intelligencer, he states that all \"novels that use the 'N-word' repeatedly need to go.\" He states that teaching the novel is not only unnecessary, but difficult due to the offensive language within the novel with many students becoming uncomfortable at \"just hear[ing] the N-word.\"[46]In 2016, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was removed from a public school district in Virginia, along with the novel To Kill a Mockingbird, due to their use of racial slurs.[47][48]Expurgated editions\n[edit]Publishers have made their own attempts at easing the controversy by way of releasing editions of the book with the word \"nigger\" replaced by less controversial words. A 2011 edition of the book, published by NewSouth Books, employed the word \"slave\" (although the word is not properly applied to a freed man). Their argument for making the change was to offer the reader a choice of reading a \"sanitized\" version if they were not comfortable with the original.[49] Mark Twain scholar Alan Gribben said he hoped the edition would be more friendly for use in classrooms, rather than have the work banned outright from classroom reading lists due to its language.[50]According to publisher Suzanne La Rosa, \"At NewSouth, we saw the value in an edition that would help the works find new readers. If the publication sparks good debate about how language impacts learning or about the nature of censorship or the way in which racial slurs exercise their baneful influence, then our mission in publishing this new edition of Twain's works will be more emphatically fulfilled.\"[51] Another scholar, Thomas Wortham, criticized the changes, saying the new edition \"doesn't challenge children to ask, 'Why would a child like Huck use such reprehensible language?'\"[52]Film\n[edit]Television\n[edit]Other\n[edit]Literature\n[edit]Music\n[edit]Television\n[edit]^ Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer's comrade)…. 1885.\n^ \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn | Summary & Characters\".

{"title":"Pride and Prejudice","author":"Jane Austen","published":1813,"fiction":true,"plot":"In the early 19th century, the Bennet family lives at their Longbourn estate, situated near the village of Meryton in Hertfordshire, England. Mrs. Bennet's greatest desire is to marry off her five daughters to secure their futures.The arrival of Mr. Bingley, a rich bachelor who rents the neighbouring Netherfield estate, gives her hope that one of her daughters might contract a marriage to the advantage, because, as stated in the novel's opening sentence, \"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife\". At a ball, the family is introduced to the Netherfield party, including Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, Caroline, who is unmarried, and Louisa, who is married to Mr. Hurst, and his closest friend Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bingley's friendly and cheerful manner earns him popularity among the guests. He appears interested in Jane, the eldest Bennet daughter. Mr. Darcy, reputed to be twice as wealthy as Mr. Bingley, is haughty and aloof, causing a decided dislike of him. He declines to dance with Elizabeth, the second-eldest Bennet daughter, as she is \"not handsome enough\". Although she jokes about it with her friend, Elizabeth is deeply offended. Despite this first impression, Mr. Darcy secretly begins to find himself drawn to Elizabeth as they continue to encounter each other at social events, appreciating her wit and frankness.Mr. Collins, the heir to the Longbourn estate, visits the Bennet family with the intention of finding a wife among the five girls under the advice of his patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh, also revealed to be Mr. Darcy's aunt. He decides to pursue Elizabeth. The Bennet family meets the charming army officer George Wickham, who tells Elizabeth in confidence that Mr. Darcy had treated him unpleasantly in the past. Elizabeth's prejudice toward Mr. Darcy leads her to believe Wickham. Elizabeth dances with Mr. Darcy at a ball where Mrs. Bennet hints loudly that she expects Jane and Bingley to become engaged. Elizabeth rejects Mr. Collins' marriage proposal, to her mother's fury and her father's relief. Mr. Collins subsequently proposes to Charlotte Lucas, a friend of Elizabeth's, and is accepted. Having heard Mrs. Bennet's words at the ball, and disapproving of the marriage, Mr. Darcy joins Mr. Bingley in a trip to London and, with the help of his sisters, persuades him not to return to Netherfield. A heartbroken Jane visits her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner in London to raise her spirits, while Elizabeth's hatred for Mr. Darcy grows, as she suspects he was responsible for Mr. Bingley's departure.In the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr. Collins in Kent. Elizabeth and her hosts are invited to Rosings Park, Lady Catherine's home. Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, are also visiting Rosings Park. Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth how Mr. Darcy recently saved a friend, presumably Bingley, from an undesirable match. Elizabeth realises that the prevented engagement was to Jane. Mr. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, declaring his love for her despite her low social connections. She is shocked, as she was unaware of Mr. Darcy's interest, and rejects him angrily, saying that he is the last person she would ever marry and that she could never love a man who caused her sister such unhappiness; she further accuses him of treating Wickham unjustly. Mr. Darcy brags about his success in separating Bingley and Jane and sarcastically dismisses the accusation regarding Wickham without addressing it. The next day, Mr. Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter explaining that Wickham, the son of his late father's steward, had refused the \"living\" his father had arranged for him and was instead given money for it. Wickham quickly squandered the money and tried to elope with Darcy's 15-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her considerable dowry. Mr. Darcy also writes that he separated Jane and Bingley because he believed her to be indifferent to Bingley and because of the lack of propriety displayed by her family. Elizabeth is ashamed by her family's behaviour and her own prejudice against Mr. Darcy.Months later, Elizabeth accompanies the Gardiners on a tour of Derbyshire. They persuade Elizabeth to visit Pemberley, Darcy's estate, noting that he is unlikely to be at home. When Mr. Darcy returns unexpectedly, he is exceedingly gracious with Elizabeth and the Gardiners. Elizabeth is surprised by Darcy's behaviour and grows fond of him, even coming to regret rejecting his proposal. She receives news that her sister Lydia has run off with Wickham. She tells Mr. Darcy; both depart in haste. After an agonising interim, Wickham agrees to marry Lydia; all assume that Gardiner has paid Wickham. Lydia and Wickham visit the Bennet family at Longbourn; Lydia tells Elizabeth that Mr. Darcy was at her wedding. Though Mr. Darcy had sworn everyone involved to secrecy, Mrs. Gardiner now feels obliged to inform Elizabeth that he secured the match, at great expense and trouble to himself.Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy return to Netherfield. Jane accepts Mr. Bingley's proposal. Lady Catherine, having heard rumours that Elizabeth intends to marry Mr. Darcy, visits her and demands she promise never to accept Mr. Darcy's proposal, as she and Darcy's late mother had already planned his marriage to her daughter Anne. Elizabeth refuses and asks the outraged Lady Catherine to leave. Darcy, heartened by his aunt's indignant relaying of Elizabeth's response, again proposes to her and is accepted.Diagram showing relationships among the principal characters ofPride and PrejudiceMany critics take the title as the start when analysing the themes of Pride and Prejudice but Robert Fox cautions against reading too much into the title (which was initially First Impressions), because commercial factors may have played a role in its selection. \"After the success of Sense and Sensibility, nothing would have seemed more natural than to bring out another novel of the same author using again the formula of antithesis and alliteration for the title.\"The qualities of the title are not exclusively assigned to one or the other of the protagonists; both Elizabeth and Darcy display pride and prejudice.\"[8] The phrase \"pride and prejudice\" had been used over the preceding two centuries by Joseph Hall, Jeremy Taylor, Joseph Addison and Samuel Johnson.[9][10] Austen is thought to have taken her title from a passage in Fanny Burney's Cecilia (1782), a novel she is known to have admired:A theme in much of Austen's work is the importance of environment and upbringing in developing young people's character and morality.[12] Social standing and wealth are not necessarily advantages in her works, and a further theme common to Austen's work is ineffectual parents. In Pride and Prejudice, the failure of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet as parents is blamed for Lydia's lack of moral judgment. Darcy has been taught to be principled and scrupulously honourable but he is also proud and overbearing.[12] Kitty, rescued from Lydia's bad influence and spending more time with her older sisters after they marry, is said to improve greatly in their superior society.[13]The American novelist Anna Quindlen observed in an introduction to an edition of Austen's novel in 1995:Marriage\n[edit]Main article: Marriage in the works of Jane AustenThe opening line of the novel announces: \"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\"[15] This sets marriage as a motif and a central idea in the novel. Readers are poised to question whether or not these single men need a wife, or if the need is dictated by the \"neighbourhood\" families and their daughters who require a \"good fortune\". According to American Book Review the opening line of Pride and Prejudice is considered second on their list of top 100 greatest opening lines in English literature after Moby Dick's \"Call me Ishmael\".[16]Marriage is a complex social activity that takes political and financial economy into account. In the case of Charlotte Lucas, the seeming success of her marriage lies in the comfortable financial circumstances of their household, while the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet serves to illustrate bad marriages based on an initial attraction and surface over substance (economic and psychological).The Bennets' marriage is an example that the youngest Bennet, Lydia, re-enacts with Wickham and the results are far from felicitous. Although the central characters, Elizabeth and Darcy, begin the novel as hostile acquaintances and unlikely friends, they eventually work toward a better understanding of themselves and each other, which frees them to truly fall in love. This does not eliminate the challenges of the real differences in their technically equivalent social status as gentry and their female relations. It does however provide them with a better understanding of each other's point of view from the different ends of the rather wide scale of differences within that category.When Elizabeth rejects Darcy's first proposal, the argument of marrying for love is introduced. Elizabeth accepts Darcy's proposal only when she is certain she loves him and her feelings are reciprocated.[17] Austen's complex sketching of different marriages ultimately allows readers to question what forms of alliance are desirable especially when it comes to privileging economic, sexual, or companionate attraction.[18]Wealth\n[edit]Money plays a fundamental role in the marriage market, for the young ladies seeking a well-off husband and for men who wish to marry a woman of means. George Wickham tries to elope with Georgiana Darcy, and Colonel Fitzwilliam states that he will marry someone with wealth.Marrying a woman of a rich family also ensured a linkage to a higher-class family, as is visible in the desires of Bingley's sisters to have their brother married to Georgiana Darcy. Mrs. Bennet is frequently seen encouraging her daughters to marry a wealthy man of high social class. In chapter 1, when Mr. Bingley arrives, she declares \"I am thinking of his marrying one of them\".[19]Inheritance was by descent but could be further restricted by entailment, which in the case of the Longbourn estate restricted inheritance to male heirs only. In the case of the Bennet family, Mr. Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr. Bennet's death in the absence of any closer male heirs, and his proposal to Elizabeth would have ensured her security; but she refuses his offer.Inheritance laws benefited males because married women did not have independent legal rights until the second half of the 19th century. For the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and the children she was to have.[20] The irony of the opening line is that generally within this society it would be a woman who would be looking for a wealthy husband to have a prosperous life.[21]Class\n[edit]Austen might be known now for her \"romances\" but the marriages in her novels engage with economics and class distinction. Pride and Prejudice is hardly the exception.When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, he cites their economic and social differences as an obstacle his excessive love has had to overcome, though he still anxiously harps on the problems it poses for him within his social circle. His aunt, Lady Catherine, later characterises these differences in particularly harsh terms when she conveys what Elizabeth's marriage to Darcy will become, \"Will the shades of Pemberley be thus polluted?\" Although Elizabeth responds to Lady Catherine's accusations that hers is a potentially contaminating economic and social position (Elizabeth even insists she and Darcy, as gentleman's daughter and gentleman, are \"equals\"), Lady Catherine refuses to accept the possibility of Darcy's marriage to Elizabeth. However, as the novel closes, \"...through curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself\", Lady Catherine condescends to visit them at Pemberley.[22]The Bingleys present a particular problem for navigating class. Though Caroline Bingley and Mrs. Hurst behave and speak of others as if they have always belonged in the upper echelons of society, Austen makes it clear that the Bingley fortunes stem from trade. The fact that Bingley rents Netherfield Hall – it is, after all, \"to let\" – distinguishes him significantly from Darcy, whose estate belonged to his father's family and who through his mother is the grandson and nephew of an earl. Bingley, unlike Darcy, does not own his property but has portable and growing wealth that makes him a good catch on the marriage market for poorer daughters of the gentry, like Jane Bennet, or of ambitious merchants. Class plays a central role in the evolution of the characters and Jane Austen's radical approach to class is seen as the plot unfolds.[23]An undercurrent of the old Anglo-Norman upper class is hinted at in the story, as suggested by the names of Fitzwilliam Darcy and his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh; Fitzwilliam, D'Arcy, de Bourgh (Burke), and even Bennet, are traditional Norman surnames.[24]Self-knowledge\n[edit]Through their interactions and their critiques of each other, Darcy and Elizabeth come to recognise their faults and work to correct them. Elizabeth meditates on her own mistakes thoroughly in chapter 36:Other characters rarely exhibit this depth of understanding or at least are not given the space within the novel for this sort of development.Tanner writes that Mrs. Bennet in particular, \"has a very limited view of the requirements of that performance; lacking any introspective tendencies she is incapable of appreciating the feelings of others and is only aware of material objects\".[26] Mrs Bennet's behaviour reflects the society in which she lives, as she knows that her daughters will not succeed if they do not get married. \"The business of her life was to get her daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.\"[27] This shows that Mrs. Bennet is only aware of \"material objects\" and not of her feelings and emotions.[28]A notable exception is Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth Bennet's close friend and confidant. She accepts Mr. Collins's proposal of marriage once Lizzie rejects him, not out of sentiment but acute awareness of her circumstances as \"one of a large family\". Charlotte's decision is reflective of her prudent nature and awareness.Pride and Prejudice, like most of Austen's works, employs the narrative technique of free indirect speech, which has been defined as \"the free representation of a character's speech, by which one means, not words actually spoken by a character, but the words that typify the character's thoughts, or the way the character would think or speak, if she thought or spoke\".[29]Austen creates her characters with fully developed personalities and unique voices. Though Darcy and Elizabeth are very alike, they are also considerably different.[30] By using narrative that adopts the tone and vocabulary of a particular character (in this case, Elizabeth), Austen invites the reader to follow events from Elizabeth's viewpoint, sharing her prejudices and misapprehensions. \"The learning curve, while undergone by both protagonists, is disclosed to us solely through Elizabeth's point of view and her free indirect speech is essential ... for it is through it that we remain caught, if not stuck, within Elizabeth's misprisions.\"[29]The few times the reader is allowed to gain further knowledge of another character's feelings, is through the letters exchanged in this novel. Darcy's first letter to Elizabeth is an example of this as through his letter, the reader and Elizabeth are both given knowledge of Wickham's true character.Austen is known to use irony throughout the novel especially from viewpoint of the character of Elizabeth Bennet. She conveys the \"oppressive rules of femininity that actually dominate her life and work, and are covered by her beautifully carved trojan horse of ironic distance.\"[5] Beginning with a historical investigation of the development of a particular literary form and then transitioning into empirical verifications, it reveals free indirect discourse as a tool that emerged over time as practical means for addressing the physical distinctness of minds. Seen in this way, free indirect discourse is a distinctly literary response to an environmental concern, providing a scientific justification that does not reduce literature to a mechanical extension of biology, but takes its value to be its own original form.[31]Austen began writing the novel after staying at Goodnestone Park in Kent with her brother Edward and his wife in 1796.[32] It was originally titled First Impressions, and was written between October 1796 and August 1797.[33] On 1 November 1797 Austen's father sent a letter to London bookseller Thomas Cadell to ask if he had any interest in seeing the manuscript, but the offer was declined by return post.[34]The militia were mobilised after the French declaration of war on Britain in February 1793, and there was initially a lack of barracks for all the militia regiments, requiring the militia to set up huge camps in the countryside, which the novel refers to several times.[35]: 57  The Brighton camp for which the militia regiment leaves in May after spending the winter in Meryton was opened in August 1793, and the barracks for all the regiments of the militia were completed by 1796, placing the events of the novel between 1793 and 1795.[35]: 56–57 Austen made significant revisions to the manuscript for First Impressions between 1811 and 1812.[33] As nothing remains of the original manuscript, study of the first drafts of the novel is reduced to conjecture. From the large number of letters in the final novel, it is assumed that First Impressions was an epistolary novel.[36]She later renamed the story Pride and Prejudice around 1811/1812, when she sold the rights to publish the manuscript to Thomas Egerton for £110[37] (equivalent to £9,300 in 2023). In renaming the novel, Austen probably had in mind the \"sufferings and oppositions\" summarised in the final chapter of Fanny Burney's Cecilia, called \"Pride and Prejudice\", where the phrase appears three times in block capitals.[12]It is possible that the novel's original title was altered to avoid confusion with other works. In the years between the completion of First Impressions and its revision into Pride and Prejudice, two other works had been published under that name: a novel by Margaret Holford and a comedy by Horace Smith.[34]Austen sold the copyright for the novel to Thomas Egerton from the Military Library, Whitehall in exchange for £110 (Austen had asked for £150).[38] This proved a costly decision. Austen had published Sense and Sensibility on a commission basis, whereby she indemnified the publisher against any losses and received any profits, less costs and the publisher's commission. Unaware that Sense and Sensibility would sell out its edition, making her £140,[34] she passed the copyright to Egerton for a one-off payment, meaning that all the risk (and all the profits) would be his. Jan Fergus has calculated that Egerton subsequently made around £450 from just the first two editions of the book.[39]Egerton published the first edition of Pride and Prejudice in three hardcover volumes on 28 January 1813.[40] It was advertised in The Morning Chronicle, priced at 18s.[33] Favourable reviews saw this edition sold out, with a second edition published in October that year. A third edition was published in 1817.[38]Foreign language translations first appeared in 1813 in French; subsequent translations were published in German, Danish, and Swedish.[41]Pride and Prejudice was first published in the United States in August 1832 as Elizabeth Bennet or, Pride and Prejudice.[38] The novel was also included in Richard Bentley's Standard Novel series in 1833. R. W. Chapman's scholarly edition of Pride and Prejudice, first published in 1923, has become the standard edition on which many modern published versions of the novel are based.[38]The novel was originally published anonymously, as were all of Austen's novels. However, whereas her first published novel, Sense and Sensibility was presented as being written \"by a Lady,\" Pride and Prejudice was attributed to \"the Author of Sense and Sensibility\". This began to consolidate a conception of Austen as an author, albeit anonymously. Her subsequent novels were similarly attributed to the anonymous author of all her then-published works.Main article: Reception history of Jane Austen19th century\n[edit]The novel was well received, with three favourable reviews in the first months following publication.[39]Anne Isabella Milbanke, later to be the wife of Lord Byron, called it \"the fashionable novel\".[39] Noted critic and reviewer George Henry Lewes declared that he \"would rather have written Pride and Prejudice, or Tom Jones, than any of the Waverley Novels\".[42]Throughout the 19th century, not all reviews of the work were positive. Charlotte Brontë, in a letter to Lewes, wrote that Pride and Prejudice was a disappointment, \"a carefully fenced, highly cultivated garden, with neat borders and delicate flowers; but [...] no open country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny beck\".[42][43] Along with her, Mark Twain was overwhelmingly negative of the work. He stated, \"Everytime I read Pride and Prejudice I want to dig [Austen] up and beat her over the skull with her own shin-bone.\"[44]Austen for her part thought the \"playfulness and epigrammaticism\" of Pride and Prejudice was excessive, complaining in a letter to her sister Cassandra in 1813 that the novel lacked \"shade\" and should have had a chapter \"of solemn specious nonsense, about something unconnected with the story; an essay on writing, a critique on Walter Scott or the history of Buonaparté\".[45]Walter Scott wrote in his journal, \"Read again and for the third time at least, Miss Austen's very finely written novel of Pride and Prejudice.\"[46]20th century\n[edit]You could not shock her more than she shocks me,\nBeside her Joyce seems innocent as grass.\nIt makes me most uncomfortable to see\nAn English spinster of the middle class\nDescribe the amorous effects of 'brass',\nReveal so frankly and with such sobriety\nThe economic basis of society.\n\nW. H. Auden (1937) on Austen[42]The American scholar Claudia L. Johnson defended the novel from the criticism that it has an unrealistic fairy-tale quality.[47] One critic, Mary Poovey, wrote that the \"romantic conclusion\" of Pride and Prejudice is an attempt to hedge the conflict between the \"individualistic perspective inherent in the bourgeois value system and the authoritarian hierarchy retained from traditional, paternalistic society\".[47] Johnson wrote that Austen's view of a power structure capable of reformation was not an \"escape\" from conflict.[47] Johnson wrote the \"outrageous unconventionality\" of Elizabeth Bennet was in Austen's own time very daring, especially given the strict censorship that was imposed in Britain by the Prime Minister, William Pitt, in the 1790s when Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice.[47]In the early twentieth century, the term \"Collins,\" named for Austen's William Collins, came into use as slang for a thank-you note to a host.[48][49]21st century\n[edit]Film, television and theatre\n[edit]See also: Jane Austen in popular culture – Pride and PrejudiceNumerous screen adaptations have contributed in popularising Pride and Prejudice.[59]The first television adaptation of the novel, written by Michael Barry, was produced in 1938 by the BBC. It is a lost television broadcast.[59] Some of the notable film versions include the 1940 Academy Award-winning film, starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier[60] (based in part on Helen Jerome's 1935 stage adaptation) and that of 2005, starring Keira Knightley (an Oscar-nominated performance) and Matthew Macfadyen.[61] Television versions include two by the BBC: a 1980 version starring Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul and a 1995 version, starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.A stage version created by Helen Jerome premiered at the Music Box Theatre in New York in 1935, starring Adrianne Allen and Colin Keith-Johnston, and opened at the St James's Theatre in London in 1936, starring Celia Johnson and Hugh Williams. Elizabeth Refuses a play by Margaret Macnamara of scenes from the novel was made into a TV programme by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 1957.[62]First Impressions was a 1959 Broadway musical version starring Polly Bergen, Farley Granger, and Hermione Gingold.[63] In 1995, a musical concept album was written by Bernard J. Taylor, with Claire Moore in the role of Elizabeth Bennet and Peter Karrie in the role of Mr Darcy.[64] A new stage production, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, The New Musical, was presented in concert on 21 October 2008 in Rochester, New York, with Colin Donnell as Darcy.[65] The Swedish composer Daniel Nelson based his 2011 opera Stolthet och fördom on Pride and Prejudice.[66] Works inspired by the book include Bride and Prejudice and Trishna (1985 Hindi TV series).The Lizzie Bennet Diaries – which premiered on a dedicated YouTube channel on 9 April 2012,[67] and concluded on 28 March 2013[68] – is an Emmy award-winning web-series[69] which recounts the story via vlogs recorded primarily by the Bennet sisters.[70][71] It was created by Hank Green and Bernie Su.[72]In 2017, the bicentenary year of Austen's death, Pride and Prejudice – An adaptation in Words and Music to music by Carl Davis from the 1995 film and text by Gill Hornby was performed in the UK, with Hayley Mills as the narrator[73] This adaptation was presented in 2024 at the Sydney Opera House and the Arts Centre Melbourne, narrated by Nadine Garner.[74]In 2018, part of the storyline of the Brazilian soap opera Orgulho e Paixão, aired on TV Globo, was inspired by the book. The soap opera was also inspired by other works of Jane Austen. It features actors, Nathalia Dill, Thiago Lacerda, Agatha Moreira, Rodrigo Simas, Gabriela Duarte, Marcelo Faria [pt], Alessandra Negrini, and Natália do Vale.[75]Fire Island is a movie written by Joel Kim Booster that reimagines Pride and Prejudice as a gay drama set on the quintessential gay vacation destination of Fire Island. Booster describes the movie \"as an unapologetic and modern twist on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.\"[76] The movie was released in June 2022 and features a main cast of Asian-American actors.Literature\n[edit]Main article: List of literary adaptations of Pride and PrejudiceIn Gwyn Cready's comedic romance novel, Seducing Mr Darcy, the heroine lands in Pride and Prejudice by way of magic massage, has a fling with Darcy and unknowingly changes the rest of the story.[77]Abigail Reynolds is the author of seven Regency-set variations on Pride and Prejudice. Her Pemberley Variations series includes Mr Darcy's Obsession, To Conquer Mr Darcy, What Would Mr Darcy Do and Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy: The Last Man in the World. Her modern adaptation, The Man Who Loved Pride and Prejudice, is set on Cape Cod.[78]Bella Breen is the author of nine variations on Pride and Prejudice. Pride and Prejudice and Poison, Four Months to Wed, Forced to Marry and The Rescue of Elizabeth Bennet.[79]In March 2009, Seth Grahame-Smith's Pride and Prejudice and Zombies takes Austen's work and mashes it up with zombie hordes, cannibalism, ninja and ultraviolent mayhem.[80] In March 2010, Quirk Books published a prequel by Steve Hockensmith that deals with Elizabeth Bennet's early days as a zombie hunter, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: Dawn of the Dreadfuls.[81] The 2016 film of Grahame-Smith's adaptation was released starring Lily James, Sam Riley and Matt Smith.Marvel has also published their take on this classic by releasing a short comic series of five issues that stays true to the original storyline. The first issue was published on 1 April 2009 and was written by Nancy Hajeski.[82] It was published as a graphic novel in 2010 with artwork by Hugo Petrus.Pamela Aidan is the author of a trilogy of books telling the story of Pride and Prejudice from Mr Darcy's point of view: Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman. The books are An Assembly Such as This,[83]Duty and Desire[84] and These Three Remain.[85]Detective novel author P. D. James has written a book titled Death Comes to Pemberley, which is a murder mystery set six years after Elizabeth and Darcy's marriage.[86]Sandra Lerner's sequel to Pride and Prejudice, Second Impressions, develops the story and imagined what might have happened to the original novel's characters. It is written in the style of Austen after extensive research into the period and language and published in 2011 under the pen name of Ava Farmer.[87]Jo Baker's bestselling 2013 novel Longbourn imagines the lives of the servants of Pride and Prejudice.[88] A cinematic adaptation of Longbourn was due to start filming in late 2018, directed by Sharon Maguire, who also directed Bridget Jones's Diary and Bridget Jones's Baby, screenplay by Jessica Swale, produced by Random House Films and StudioCanal.[89] The novel was also adapted for radio, appearing on BBC Radio 4's Book at Bedtime, abridged by Sara Davies and read by Sophie Thompson. It was first broadcast in May 2014; and again on Radio 4 Extra in September 2018.[90]In the novel Eligible, Curtis Sittenfeld sets the characters of Pride and Prejudice in modern-day Cincinnati, where the Bennet parents, erstwhile Cincinnati social climbers, have fallen on hard times. Elizabeth, a successful and independent New York journalist, and her single older sister Jane must intervene to salvage the family's financial situation and get their unemployed adult sisters to move out of the house and onward in life. In the process they encounter Chip Bingley, a young doctor and reluctant reality TV celebrity, and his medical school classmate, Fitzwilliam Darcy, a cynical neurosurgeon.[91][92]Pride and Prejudice has also inspired works of scientific writing. In 2010, scientists named a pheromone identified in male mouse urine darcin,[93] after Mr Darcy, because it strongly attracted females. In 2016, a scientific paper published in the Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease speculated that Mrs Bennet may have been a carrier of a rare genetic disease, explaining why the Bennets didn't have any sons, and why some of the Bennet sisters are so silly.[94]In summer 2014, Udon Entertainment's Manga Classics line published a manga adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.[95]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}\"Monstersandcritics.com\".

Dowell tells the story of those dissolutions, plus the deaths of three characters and the madness of a fourth, in a rambling, non-chronological fashion. As an unreliable narrator the reader can consider whether they believe Dowell and his description of how the events unfolded including his own role in the \"saddest story ever told\".Events as narrated\n[edit]The novel opens with the famous line: \"This is the saddest story I have ever heard.\" Dowell explains that for nine years he, his wife Florence and their friends Captain Edward Ashburnham (the \"good soldier\" of the book's title) and his wife Leonora, had an ostensibly normal friendship while Edward and Florence sought treatment for their heart ailments at a spa in Nauheim, Germany.As it turns out, nothing in the relationships or in the characters is as it first seems. Florence's heart ailment is a fiction she perpetrated on John to ensure that he did not seek intimacy from her as it would seemingly be too stressful for her heart, and so to keep him out of her bedroom at night in order that she could continue her affair with an American artist named Jimmy. Edward and Leonora have an unbalanced marriage broken by his constant infidelities (both of body and heart) and by Leonora's attempts to control Edward's affairs (both financial and romantic). Dowell is an innocent American who is coming to realise how much he has been fooled as Florence and Edward had an affair under his nose for nine years without his knowing until Florence was dead.Dowell tells the story of Edward and Leonora's relationship which appears normal to others but which is a power struggle that Leonora wins. Dowell narrates several of Edward's affairs and peccadilloes including his possibly innocent attempt to comfort a crying servant on a train, his affair with the married Maisie Maidan, the one character in the book whose heart problem was unquestionably real, and his bizarre tryst in Monte Carlo and Antibes with a kept woman known as La Dolciquita. Edward's philandering ends up costing them a fortune in bribes, blackmail and gifts for his lovers leading Leonora to take control of Edward's financial affairs. She gradually gets him out of debt.Florence's affair with Edward leads her to commit suicide when she realises both that Edward is falling in love with his and Leonora's young ward, Nancy Rufford, and that Dowell has found out about her affair with Jimmy. Florence sees Edward and Nancy in an intimate conversation and rushes back to the resort where she sees John talking to a man she used to know (and who knows of her affair with Jimmy). Assuming that her relationship with Edward and her marriage to John are over, Florence takes prussic acid—which she has carried for years in a vial that John thought held her heart medicine—and dies.Edward's last affair is his most scandalous as he becomes infatuated with Nancy. Nancy came to live with the Ashburnhams after leaving a convent where her parents had sent her; her mother was a violent alcoholic and her father (it is later suggested that this man may not be Nancy's biological father) may have abused her. Edward, tearing himself apart because he does not want to spoil Nancy's innocence, arranges to have her sent to India to live with her father, even though this frightens her terribly. Once Leonora knows that Edward intends to keep his passion for Nancy chaste, only wanting Nancy to continue to love him from afar, she torments him by making this wish impossible. She pretends to offer to divorce him so he can marry Nancy but informs Nancy of his sordid sexual history, destroying Nancy's innocent love for him. After Nancy's departure, Edward receives a telegram from her that reads, \"Safe Brindisi. Having a rattling good time. Nancy.\" He asks Dowell to take the telegram to his wife, pulls out his pen knife, says that it is time he had some rest and slits his own throat. When Nancy reaches Aden and sees the obituary in the paper, she becomes catatonic.The novel's last section has Dowell writing from Edward's old estate in England where he takes care of Nancy whom he cannot marry because of her mental illness. Nancy is only capable of repeating two things—a Latin phrase meaning \"I believe in an omnipotent God\" and the word \"shuttlecocks\". Dowell states that the story is sad because no one got what they wanted. Leonora wanted Edward but lost him and ended up marrying the normal (but dull) Rodney Bayham. Edward wanted Nancy but gave her up then lost her. Dowell wanted a wife but ended up a nurse to two women.Dowell ends up generally unsure about where to lay the blame, but expressing sympathy for Edward because he believes himself similar to Edward in nature. The fact is he has been disengaged, a voyeur. While the other characters are flawed, he has never participated in life. He is revealed as less than the foolish innocent he represents himself as, when he walks away, leaving Edward to slit his throat with a very small pen knife.Textual analysis\n[edit]The novel has potential narrative inconsistencies that suggest different, hidden plot elements. For example, Dowell marries an heiress who ostensibly has a bad heart. He states repeatedly that he has no need or interest in her money—one might argue that he protests his lack of interest rather too much. Florence eventually dies, stated by Dowell to be suicide. If readers suspend their trust in the narrator, some may be left with the impression that the narrator is happy his wife dies, as he does little to prevent it, just as he does little throughout the entire book. Thus, behind the more or less explicit narrative lurks a possible counter-narrative in which Dowell is something of a sociopath, caring for no one but himself, an observer of others who are living more fully while never actively engaging very intensely in life himself, and indeed, perhaps a voyeur relishing the demise of others. This would be the story of a manipulative man trying to elicit the sympathy of the audience he speaks/writes to, which must decide whether he is a deluded victim or a heartless manipulator of the reader's emotions.Florence supposedly poisons herself in a possibly painful manner, and Edward supposedly cuts his own throat, but as always in this novel, we only have Dowell's word for it, and he epitomises the \"unreliable narrator.\" The reader must decide just how much of the truth Dowell reveals. Some commentators have even suggested that Dowell, who presents himself as considered by all to be passive, murders both Florence and Edward. In this view the entire story is his justification for doing so without his admitting his guilt.Religious references are omnipresent throughout the book. Leonora is an Irish Catholic who cannot contemplate divorce. She is taunted about Catholicism by Florence when they all visit a castle near Nauheim which holds a relic of Martin Luther's Protest. Ashburnham is an Anglican by birth who wants to build a Catholic chapel on his property for Leonora and who would have converted to Catholicism had he been spurred to it by his wife, who remains indifferent.How well can we judge the characterisations in the novel when Dowell is such an unreliable narrator? A question to consider is whether he presented himself in a true light or manipulated his description of events to prevent the reader from discovering his true character. HoweverDowell admits that his assumptions and characterisations of the people in his life may be flawed.The novel was adapted into the television film of the same title by Granada Television in 1981. It starred Jeremy Brett, Vickery Turner, Robin Ellis and Susan Fleetwood. It was directed by Kevin Billington and written by Julian Mitchell. In the US it aired as part of the Masterpiece Theatre series.[7]The novel was adapted as a BBC Radio 4 Book at Bedtime by Lu Kemp in 2008, read by Toby Stephens and produced by Kirsty Williams.[8][9]In 2020 the novel was adapted by Sebastian Baczkiewicz as a one hour radio play as part of the BBC Radio 4 Electric Decade season of classic titles that influenced and characterised the Jazz Age of the 1920s.[10]Burt, Daniel S.

{"title":"Where the Wild Things Are","author":"Maurice Sendak","published":1963,"fiction":true,"plot":"The story focuses on a young boy named Max who, after dressing in his wolf suit, wreaks such havoc through his household that he is sent to bed without his supper. Max's bedroom transforms into a jungle environment, and he winds up sailing to an island inhabited by monsters, called the Wild Things. The Wild Things try to scare Max, but to no avail. After stopping and intimidating the creatures, Max is hailed as the king of the Wild Things and enjoys a playful romp with his subjects. Finally, Max stops them and sends them to bed without their supper. However, to the Wild Things' dismay, he starts to feel lonely and decides to abdicate and return home. The creatures do not want Max to go and throw themselves into fits of rage as he calmly sails away home. Upon returning to his bedroom, Max discovers a hot supper waiting for him.Sendak began his career as an illustrator, but by the mid-1950s, Sendak had started writing and illustrating his own books.[6] In 1956, he published his first book for which he was the sole author, Kenny's Window (1956). Soon after, Sendak began work on another solo effort. The story was supposed to be that of a child who, after a tantrum, is punished in his room and decides to escape to the place that gives the book its title, the \"land of wild horses\".[6] Shortly before starting the illustrations, Sendak realized that he did not know how to draw horses and, at the suggestion of his editor, changed the wild horses to the more ambiguous \"Wild Things\", a term inspired by the Yiddish expression \"vilde chaya\" (\"wild animals\"), used to indicate boisterous children.[7]Sendak replaced the horses with caricatures of his aunts and uncles, caricatures that he had originally drawn in his youth as an escape from their chaotic weekly visits, on Sunday afternoons, to his family's Brooklyn home. Sendak, as a child, had observed his relatives as being \"all crazy – crazy faces and wild eyes\", with blood-stained eyes and \"big and yellow\" teeth, who pinched his cheeks until they were red.[6][8][9] These relatives, like Sendak's parents, were poor Jewish immigrants from Poland, whose remaining family in Nazi-occupied Europe were killed during the Holocaust while Sendak was in his early teens. As a child, he saw them as \"grotesques\".[9][10]When working on the 1983 opera adaptation of the book with Oliver Knussen, Sendak gave the monsters the names of his relatives: Tzippy, Moishe, Aaron, Emile, and Bernard.[11]Analysis\n[edit]In Selma G. Lanes's book The Art of Maurice Sendak, Sendak discusses Where the Wild Things Are along with his other books In the Night Kitchen and Outside Over There as a trilogy centered on children's growth, survival, and fury.[12][13] He indicated that the three books are \"all variations on the same theme: how children master various feelings – danger, boredom, fear, frustration, jealousy – and manage to come to grips with the realities of their lives\".[12] Fundamental to Sendak's work for over fifty years is his trust in the validity of children's emotions.[14]Dr. Kara Keeling and Dr. Scott Pollard, both English professors, assess the role that food plays in the book, arguing that food is a metaphor for Max's mother's love based on the idea that Max comes home to a \"still hot\" supper, which suggests that his mother \"loves him best\".[15] Going along with this, Mary Pols of Time magazine wrote that \"[w]hat makes Sendak's book so compelling is its grounding effect: Max has a tantrum and in a flight of fancy visits his wild side, but he is pulled back by a belief in parental love to a supper 'still hot', balancing the seesaw of fear and comfort\".[16]Where the Wild Things Are is a story that shows children's resilience through their \"spirit\" and \"pluck\".[17] Max is able to stand up to the Wild Things with their \"terrible teeth\" and \"terrible claws\" using \"the magic trick of staring into all their yellow eyes without blinking once\".[17]Professor Liam Heneghan describes Max's dream as one of mastering the wild, from which he also learns to master his \"inner tumult\".[18] It sets forth the unrestrained rowdiness of the Wild Things and enlightens the reader to the idea that one cannot live in the wild forever. In her words: \"In this notion of wilderness, there is a heightened reminder that after our fill of wilderness, one can, or perhaps even should, return, replenished, to the comforts of home\".[18] Heneghan concludes that \"the overarching thought is an old one: a human engages with Wild Things and in so doing comes into accord with the world and gains a measure of self-mastery\".[18]Reception\n[edit]Francis Spufford suggests that Where the Wild Things Are is \"one of the very few picture books to make an entirely deliberate and beautiful use of the psychoanalytic story of anger\".[19]New York Times film critic Manohla Dargis noted that \"there are different ways to read the wild things, through a Freudian or colonialist prism, and probably as many ways to ruin this delicate story of a solitary child liberated by his imagination\".[20] Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\".[21] Five years later, School Library Journal sponsored a survey of readers which identified Where the Wild Things Are as a top picture book.[5] Elizabeth Bird, the librarian from the New York Public Library who conducted the survey, observed that there was little doubt that it would be voted number one and highlighted its designation by one reader as a watershed, \"ushering in the modern age of picture books\". Another critic called it \"perfectly crafted, perfectly illustrated ... simply the epitome of a picture book\" and noted that Sendak \"rises above the rest in part because he is subversive\". President Barack Obama read it aloud for children who were attending the White House Easter Egg Roll in multiple years.[22]New York Times writer Bruce Handy brought up the idea that \"as a child myself, without benefit of personal insights subsequently gleaned from more than a decade of talk therapy, I had been left cold by Where the Wild Things Are\".[23] Deborah Stevenson, a writer for The Horn Book Magazine, talks about the effects the book had on a child who \"screamed, apparently not with delight, every time Where the Wild Things Are was read to him. It is quite possible for some young readers or listeners to be moved to alarm by a book, just as they can be moved to joy or excitement or boredom\".[24] Sendak responded to this criticism in an interview, asking: \"Did she hate her kid? Is that why she was tormenting her with this book?\"[25]Despite the book's popularity, Sendak refused to produce a sequel; four months before his death in 2012, he told comedian Stephen Colbert that a sequel would be \"the most boring idea imaginable\".[26]Where the Wild Things Are was number four on the list of \"Top Check Outs of all time\" by the New York Public Library.[27]An animated short adaptation which had taken five years to complete was released in 1973,[28] directed and animated by Gene Deitch and produced at Krátký film, Prague, for Weston Woods. It had narration by Allen Swift and a musique concrète score composed by Deitch; an updated version, which featured a new musical score and narration both by Peter Schickele, was released in 1988. This revised version was featured in a Children's Circle video titled The Maurice Sendak Library.In the 1980s, Sendak worked with British composer Oliver Knussen on a children's opera based upon the book.[11] The opera received its first (incomplete) performance in Brussels in 1980; the first complete performance of the final version was given by the Glyndebourne Touring Opera in London in 1984. This was followed by its first U.S. performance in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1985 and the New York City premiere by New York City Opera in 1987. A concert performance was given at The Proms in the Royal Albert Hall in London in 2002.[29] A concert production was produced by New York City Opera in 2011.[30]In 1981, the New England Dinosaur Dance Company turned the book into a dance piece with choreography by Toby Armour and music by Ezra Sims.[31] The piece debuted at Boston's Wilbur Theatre on December 22, 1981.[32]In 1983, Walt Disney Productions conducted a series of tests of computer-generated imagery created by Glen Keane and John Lasseter using as their subject Where the Wild Things Are.[33]In the late 1990s the characters appeared in a series of commercials for BellAtlantic.[34]In 1999, Isadar released a solo piano musical composition titled \"Where the Wild Things Are\" which appeared on his album Active Imagination, inspired by the Sendak book. The composition was revisited and re-recorded in 2012 on Isadar's album, Reconstructed, with Grammy winner and founder of Windham Hill Records, William Ackerman, producing.[35]In 2002, the BBC produced a radio adaptation of the book, as part of their An Abominable Bestiary series.The 2005 Simpsons episode, \"The Girl Who Slept Too Little\", features a spoof of Where the Wild Things Are entitled \"The Land of the Wild Beasts\".In 2006, the United States Postal Service issued a postage stamp of the book as part of the sheet of stamps \"Favorite Children's Book Animals\".[36]A live-action film version of the book was released on October 16, 2009.[37] Directed by Spike Jonze and co-produced by Sendak, the film stars Max Records as Max and features Catherine Keener as his mother, with Lauren Ambrose, Chris Cooper, Paul Dano, James Gandolfini, Catherine O'Hara and Forest Whitaker providing the voices of the principal Wild Things. The soundtrack was written and produced by Karen O and Carter Burwell. The screenplay was adapted by Jonze in collaboration with Dave Eggers, who also novelized the screenplay as The Wild Things, published in 2009.In 2012, indie rock quartet alt-J released the song \"Breezeblocks\", inspired in part by the book.[38] Alt-J keyboardist Gus Unger-Hamilton said the story and the song share similar ideas about parting with a loved one. \"Breezeblocks\" reached certified ARIA Gold status in Australia.[39]In 2016, Alessia Cara released her second single, \"Wild Things\", which charted at number fifty on the Billboard Hot 100. In an interview with ABC News Radio, Cara stated she took inspiration from Where the Wild Things Are, saying \"each 'Thing' represents an emotion and [the main character] kinda escapes into this world ... and that's kinda what I wanted to do\".[40]^ \"Where the wild things are\".

{"title":"The Power of Positive Thinking: A Practical Guide to Mastering the Problems of Everyday Living","author":"Norman Vincent Peale","published":1952,"fiction":true,"plot":"Peale begins by stating ten rules for “overcoming inadequacy attitudes and learning to practice faith”.[5] The rules include the following:The next chapter describes the importance of creating a peaceful mind, which can be done through inspirational reading, clearing one's mind, or visualization. Peale continues with how to obtain consistent energy, saying that “God is the source of all energy”.[5] The mind controls how the body feels; thus, letting go of negative energy and emotions will give infinite energy through God. Next, Peale speaks of the healing power of prayer, and how it will heal physical and emotional problems that arise from negative circumstances. In chapters five and six, Peale asserts that happiness is created by choice and that worrying only inhibits it and should be stopped. The next step in thinking positively is to always believe in success and not to believe in defeat because most obstacles are “mental in character”.[5] Habitual worrying is the next obstacle to overcome through emptying the mind and positive affirmations. Peale then states that asking God for help can solve one's personal problems and physically and emotionally heal them.In chapter twelve, Peale states that letting go of anger and embracing a sense of calm can help with physical illnesses, such as eczema.[5] Next, Peale states that letting positive thoughts in can change one's outlook on life drastically and that practicing relaxation through God's help will lead to a content life. Chapter fifteen gives concrete examples on how to get others to like you, including the following: remember names, praise others generously, become a people person, and resolve problems calmly as soon as they appear. Peale then continues with how to overcome heartache through prayer, meditation, social interactions, and keeping a daily routine. The final chapter restates the importance of reaching out to a Higher Power for help in living a peaceful, positive life. Peale ends The Power of Positive Thinking with an epilogue encouraging readers to follow his techniques and live more fulfilled lives. Peale writes, “I pray for you. God will help you — so believe and live successfully.”[5]Criticisms\n[edit]Peale's work came under criticism from various mental health experts, theologians, and academics. One general criticism of Peale's book was the lack of verified sources. The Power of Positive Thinking includes many personal anecdotes that the reader has no way of validating. The book includes stories about “a business executive”,[5] “a man, an alcoholic”,[5] “a famous trapeze artist”,[5] “a friend of [Peale’s], a midwestern businessman”,[5] and other unnamed individuals which cannot be verified from the information Peale presents with each anecdote.Similarity to hypnosis\n[edit]Psychiatrist R. C. Murphy addresses another criticism of Peale's work in an article in The Nation dated May 7, 1955. He compares Peale's message in The Power of Positive Thinking to that of hypnosis, writing that \"self-knowledge, in Mr. Peale's understanding, is unequivocally bad; self-hypnosis is good.\"[9] Murphy explains that such repeated hypnosis defeats an individual's self-motivation, sense of reality, and ability to think critically. He describes Peale's understanding of the mind as inaccurate and his description of the workings of the mind as deceptively simplistic and false. Murphy states that if man's unconscious “can be conceptualized merely as a container for a small number of psychic fragments, then ideas like 'mind-drainage' follow. So does the reliance on self-hypnosis, which is the cornerstone of Mr. Peale's philosophy.” Murphy concludes that Peale's techniques for positive thinking relate too closely to hypnosis and are inadequate for the readers’ needs for self-improvement.[9]Albert Ellis, an influential psychologist of the 20th century and the founder of cognitive therapy, also criticized Peale's techniques for their similarities with hypnotism. He compared the techniques presented with those of the hypnotist Émile Coué and asserted that the repeated use of these hypnotic techniques could lead to significant mental health problems. Ellis stated that eventually Peale's teachings “lead to failure and disillusionment, and not only boomerang back against people, but often prejudice them against effective therapy.\"[10]Effectiveness of techniques\n[edit]Another criticism is that Peale's philosophy is not accomplished through his techniques presented. R. C. Murphy writes that Peale's teachings “endorse the cruelties which men commit against each other” which encourages readers to “give up [their] strivings and feel free to hate as much as [they] like”. Murphy argues that by teaching others to destroy all negativity, Peale is, in fact, fostering negativity and aggression.[9] Harvard scholar Donald Meyer presents a similar criticism in his article \"Confidence Man\" written in 1955. Meyer writes that The Power of Positive Thinking provides partial awareness to the limitations of the readers, but does not supply the necessary self-confidence to overcome those limitations. He proceeds to compare Peale to a con man saying that the problem with Peale lies in the “paltriness of the confidence he preached. He did not really try to fool you into thinking you could do much, or be much, or live much. He did not make you aware of greater heights any more than of greater abysses.”[11]Psychologist Martin Seligman, former APA president and founder of positive psychology, also condemned Peale's methods in his book, Authentic Happiness. He writes that, “positive thinking often involves trying to believe upbeat statements such as 'Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better,' in the absence of evidence, or even in the face of contrary evidence.”[12] Seligman continues his critique saying, “if you can manage the feat of actually believing these sorts of statements, more power to you. Many educated people, trained in skeptical thinking, cannot manage this kind of boosterism.”[12]Similarly, Donald Meyer, in his book The Positive Thinkers, critiques the effectiveness of Peale's techniques saying that Peale always “reacted to the image of harshness with flight rather than competitive fight.”[13] Meyer later quotes Peale as saying, “No man, however resourceful or pugnacious, is a match for so great an adversary as a hostile world. He is at best a puny and impotent creature quite at the mercy of the cosmic and social forces in the midst of which he dwells.\"[13] Meyer argues that positive thinking is disempowering to the individual; for, Peale presents individuals as weak compared to the “hostile world” with only the help of his techniques to overcome negative circumstances. In addition, Meyer also questions the effectiveness of Peale's positive thinking techniques in the antagonistic environment Peale presents.Theological critique\n[edit]Episcopal theologian John M. Krumm criticized Peale's teachings for their basis in religion, defining his teachings as heretical. Krumm writes that \"the emphasis upon techniques such as the repetition of confident phrases” or “the manipulation of certain mechanical devices” gives “the impression of a thoroughly depersonalized religion. Very little is said about the sovereign mind and purpose of God; much is made of the things men can say to themselves and can do to bring about their ambitions and purposes.\"[14] Krumm argues that Peale does not have the backing of religion to support his techniques. Krumm continues with a warning: \"The predominant use of impersonal symbols for God is a serious and dangerous invitation to regard man as the center of reality and the Divine Reality as an impersonal power, the use and purpose of which is determined by the man who takes hold of it and employs it as he thinks best.”[14]Edmund Fuller, book review editor of the Episcopal Churchnews, warned against following Peale's teachings in an article titled “Pitchmen in the Pulpit” from March 1957. Fuller cautions readers not to believe Peale just because he was a minister. He writes that Peale's books have no connection to Christianity and that they “influence, mislead and often disillusion sick, maladjusted, unhappy or ill-constructed people, obscuring for them the Christian realities. They offer easy comforts, easy solutions to problems and mysteries that sometimes perhaps, have no comforts or solutions at all, in glib, worldly terms. They offer a cheap 'happiness' in lieu of the joy Christianity can offer.”[15]Positive reviews\n[edit]While contemporary theologians and mental health experts criticized Peale's teachings in The Power of Positive Thinking, the general public praised the self-help book. The Los Angeles Times estimates that “legions of followers testified that Peale’s message changed their lives for the better and represented the best combination of faith and pragmatism.”[7] This is evidenced by the popularity of Peale's book, which sold more than 5 million copies worldwide and was eventually translated into over 40 languages.[7] In addition, Peale was close friends with American presidents Eisenhower and Nixon, both of whom highly regarded his positive thinking teachings.[2] Countless others accredited The Power of Positive Thinking for their success in overcoming obstacles including George Foster, of the Cincinnati Reds,[16]Rev. Robert Schuller, founder and pastor of the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove,[7] and Billy Graham, a prominent Southern Baptist Minister.[6]U.S. president Donald Trump has called Peale \"his pastor\" and \"one of the greatest speakers\" he had ever seen.[17] According to Donald's niece and author Mary L. Trump, Donald Trump's father, Fred, became interested in Peale's message in the 1950s.[18] Fred and his wife, Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, traveled to the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan with their children to hear Peale's sermons. Donald Trump grew up hearing Peale's teachings from his parents, and Peale officiated his first wedding.[19] Trump credits his survival in 1990 after being almost a billion dollars in debt to Peale's positive thinking teachings.[17]The book is referenced in the 2020 DC Comics Wonder Woman sequel film, Wonder Woman 1984, the villain of which is a self-help-touting entrepreneur.[20]A Texas woman named Helen Hadsell read the book in 1959 and credited the book with much of her success in winning contests.[21] After reading the book she began entering and winning contests. She has stated from that point on she won every contest she ever entered.[22][23]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}\"Navigating Teenage Turbulence: A Roadmap with Sean Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens\".

{"title":"Fear of Flying","author":"Erica Jong","published":1973,"fiction":true,"plot":"Isadora Wing is a Jewish journalist from New York City. She and her husband Bennett fly to Vienna for the first psychoanalysts' conference since analysts were driven out during the Holocaust. She associates her fear of flying, both literally and metaphorically referring to a fear of freeing herself from the shackles of traditional male companionship, with recent articles about plane hijackings and terrorist attacks. She also associates fear and loathing with Germany, because she and her husband were stationed in Heidelberg and she struggled both to fit in and to wrestle with the hatred and danger she felt being a Jew in post-Holocaust Germany. Isadora ponders many questions, plans, mental rough drafts and reminiscences as her journey unfolds, including the \"zipless fuck,\" a major motif in the story that haunts the narrator throughout.Upon arriving, Isadora meets the English Langsian analyst Adrian Goodlove and is immediately smitten. Despite his gruff attitude and poor sexual performance, he seems to provide what she desires but does not find in her own marriage: energy, excitement, desire, danger. They begin a poorly-veiled affair by dancing and kissing rather openly at conference events, staying out nights, and spending days by German pools. Isadora's desperation to feel alive and her developing feelings for Adrian lead her to the toughest decision: to return home with Bennett or to go to London with Adrian. She agonizes over the decision. One night, Bennett finds Adrian and Isadora in bed together and joins them in an adventurous sexual act that Bennett never acknowledges afterward.Finally, through an emotionally taxing and melodramatic letter that she never delivers to Bennett because he once again walks in and interrupts her, Isadora decides to leave with Adrian. The two of them drive through France, Germany, and Italy camping every night, drinking, and making love. Along the way, Isadora confides in Adrian the stories of her past relationships and first marriage. She reveals that she met her first husband, Brian, in college, where they connected over their mutual love of literature and ability to walk for hours while quoting poetry. They gradually became distant and Brian began to fall into delusions, believing himself to be the second coming of Christ. He became violent, raped Isadora, and choked her close to death in one mental break. He was repeatedly hospitalized and eventually moved to an asylum in Los Angeles in which Brian blamed her for everything, and they finally divorced.Eventually, Adrian reveals that he has plans to meet his ex-wife and his children, leading Isadora to return home to Bennett. On a train journey to meet him in London, she is approached by an attendant who sexually assaults her, which propels her into her own psychological self-examination.She realizes that when she is not in control of her body and does not have agency or autonomy, it does not matter how much she has dreamed of a situation, but it will never be satisfying. When she returns home, she takes a bath; waits for Bennett; and comes to accept her body, herself, and the unknown future: \"A nice body. Mine. I decided to keep it\" (p. 424).It was in this novel that Erica Jong coined the term \"zipless fuck\", which soon entered the popular lexicon.[2] A \"zipless fuck\" is defined as a sexual encounter for its own sake, without emotional involvement or commitment or any ulterior motive, between two previously unacquainted persons.Jong goes on to explain that it is \"zipless\" because \"when you came together, zippers fell away like rose petals, underwear blew off in one breath like dandelion fluff. For the true ultimate zipless A-1 fuck, it was necessary that you never got to know the man very well.\"Fear of Flying was written in the throes of the Sexual Revolution of the 1970s, as associated with second-wave feminism. Finally, it was acknowledged that desire and fantasy are good things and not entirely condemnable in women, and Jong wanted to harness that newfound respect for desire into a piece of art that brought the intersections of sexual and nonsexual life together, which she felt was missing in literature. \"At the time I wrote Fear of Flying, there was not a book that said women are romantic, women are intellectual, women are sexual—and brought all those things together.\"[3] \"What [Isadora is] looking for is how to be a whole human being, a body and a mind, and that is what women were newly aware they needed in 1973.\"[4] However, she also points out the drawbacks of a sexually liberated life and acknowledges that sexuality \"is not the cure for every restlessness.\" Male critics who interpreted Isadora as being \"promiscuous\" were actually misinterpreting her acts since she has an active fantasy life but does not really sleep with many men. This does, however, allude to the possibility that other charming men can bring a woman's fantasies to life, hence \"promiscuity\" is there, just not realized.Jong says that today, women are no longer shocked by Isadora's sexuality and the depiction of sex and fantasy, but readers were when the book was first released. Instead, she sees that book mirrors the lack of pleasure that many young women experience in sexual interactions. She cites the TV show Girls as an example of media depicting sexually-liberated women but without attention to female pleasure. Just like Isadora, the women on television and alive today struggle to reconcile the empowerment of sexual freedom with the disempowerment of sex without pleasure. However, she also sees growth in the female population that live alone and \"whose lives are full with friends, travel, work, everything and who don’t feel that in some way they're inferior because they don’t have a man at their side\" as being one extremely positive result of the way sexual liberation has transformed over the decades.[4]The political battle over women's bodies today has also renewed the book's relevance in Jong's mind, constituting a 40th anniversary redistribution of the book. \"All these states are introducing crazy anti-abortion rules... passing laws that they know are unconstitutional, shutting down Planned Parenthood clinics, and making it very hard... to get birth control.\" She cites those types of political moves as a regression from the progress set out by the Sexual Revolution. She also still feels that female authors are \"second-class citizens in the publishing world,\" as Jennifer Weiner says in the introduction to the 40th anniversary edition: \"it's very hard, if you write about women and women's struggles, to be seen as important with a capital 'I'.\"[4]Jong denies that the novel is autobiographical but admits that it has autobiographical elements.[5] However, an article in The New Yorker recounts that Jong's sister, Suzanna Daou (née Mann), identified herself at a 2008 conference as the reluctant model for Isadora Wing's sister Randy and called the book \"an exposé of my life when I was living in Lebanon.\" Daou angrily denounced the book, linked its characters to people in her own life, and took her sister to task for taking cruel liberties with them, especially Daou's husband. In the book, Isadora Wing's sister Randy is married to Pierre, who makes a pass at both Wing and her two other sisters. Jong dismissed her sister's claim by saying instead that \"every intelligent family has an insane member.\"[6]Many attempts to adapt the novel for Hollywood have been made, starting with Julia Phillips, who fantasized that it would be her debut as a director, from a screenplay by David Giler. The deal fell through and Erica Jong litigated, unsuccessfully.[7] In her second novel,[8] Jong created the character Britt Goldstein, a predatory and self-absorbed Hollywood producer devoid of both talent and scruples.In May 2013 it was announced[9] that a screenplay version by Piers Ashworth had been green-lit by Blue-Sky Media, with Laurie Collyer directing.^ \"Fear of Flying (1973) by Erica Jong\".

{"title":"Dune","author":"Frank Herbert","published":1963,"fiction":true,"plot":"Duke Leto Atreides of House Atreides, ruler of the ocean world Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to serve as fief ruler of the planet Arrakis. Although Arrakis is a harsh and inhospitable desert planet, it is of enormous importance because it is the only planetary source of melange, or the \"spice\", a unique and incredibly valuable substance that extends human youth, vitality and lifespan. It is also through the consumption of spice that Spacing Guild Navigators are able to effect safe interstellar travel through a limited ability to see into the future. The Emperor is jealous of the Duke's rising popularity in the Landsraad, the council of Great Houses, and sees House Atreides as a potential rival and threat. He conspires with House Harkonnen, the former stewards of Arrakis and the longstanding enemies of the Atreides, to destroy Leto and his family after their arrival. Leto is aware his assignment is a trap of some kind, but is compelled to obey the Emperor's orders anyway.Leto's concubine Lady Jessica is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit, an exclusively female group that pursues mysterious political aims and wields seemingly superhuman physical and mental abilities, such as the ability to control their bodies down to the cellular level, and also decide the sex of their children. Though Jessica was instructed by the Bene Gesserit to bear a daughter as part of their breeding program, out of love for Leto she bore him a son, Paul. From a young age, Paul is trained in warfare by Leto's aides, the elite soldiers Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck. Thufir Hawat, the Duke's Mentat (human computers, able to store vast amounts of data and perform advanced calculations on demand), has instructed Paul in the ways of political intrigue. Jessica has also trained her son in Bene Gesserit disciplines.Paul's prophetic dreams interest Jessica's superior, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She subjects Paul to a deadly test. She holds a poisoned needle, the gom jabbar, to his neck, ready to strike should he withdraw his hand from a box which creates extreme pain by nerve induction but causes no physical damage. This is to test Paul's ability to endure the pain and override his animal instincts, proving that he is, in Bene Gesserit eyes, human. Paul passes, enduring greater pain than any woman has ever been subjected to in the test.Paul and his parents travel with their household to occupy Arrakeen, the capital on Arrakis. Leto learns of the dangers involved in harvesting the spice, which is protected by giant sandworms, and seeks to negotiate with the planet's indigenous Fremen people, seeing them as a valuable ally rather than foes. Soon after the Atreides' arrival, Harkonnen forces attack, joined by the Emperor's ferocious Sardaukar troops in disguise. Leto is betrayed by his personal physician, the Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, who delivers a drugged Leto to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and his twisted Mentat, Piter De Vries.Yueh, who delivered Leto under duress, arranges for Jessica and Paul to escape into the desert. Duncan is killed helping them flee, and they are subsequently presumed dead in a sandstorm by the Harkonnens. Yueh replaces one of Leto's teeth with a poison gas capsule, hoping Leto can kill Baron Harkonnen during their encounter. Piter kills Yueh, and the Baron narrowly avoids the gas (due to his defensive shield), which kills Leto, Piter, and the others in the room. The Baron forces Thufir to take over Piter's position by dosing him with a long-lasting, fatal poison and threatening to withhold the regular antidote doses. While he follows the Baron's orders, Thufir works secretly to undermine the Harkonnens.Having fled into the desert, Paul is exposed to high concentrations of spice and has visions through which he realizes he has significant powers (as a result of the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme). He foresees potential futures in which he lives among the Fremen before leading them on a holy war across the known universe. Paul reveals that Jessica's father is Baron Harkonnen, a secret kept from her by the Bene Gesserit.Paul and Jessica traverse the desert in search of Fremen people. After being captured by a Fremen band, Paul and Jessica agree to teach the Fremen the Bene Gesserit fighting technique known to the Fremen as the \"weirding way\" and are accepted into the community of Sietch Tabr. Paul proves his manhood by killing a Fremen man named Jamis in a ritualistic crysknife fight and chooses the Fremen name Muad'Dib, while Jessica opts to undergo a ritual to become a Reverend Mother by drinking and neutralizing the poisonous Water of Life. Pregnant with Leto's daughter, she inadvertently causes her unborn daughter Alia to become infused with the same powers in the womb. Paul takes a Fremen lover, Chani, who bears him a son he names Leto.Two years pass, and Paul's powerful prescience manifests, which confirms to the Fremen that he is their prophesied \"Lisan al-Gaib\" messiah, a legend planted by the Bene Gesserit's Missionaria Protectiva. Paul embraces his father's belief that the Fremen could be a powerful fighting force to take back Arrakis, but also sees that if he does not control them, their jihad could consume the entire universe. Word of the new Fremen leader reaches both the Baron and the Emperor as spice production falls due to their increasingly destructive raids. The Baron encourages his brutish nephew Glossu \"Beast\" Rabban to rule with an iron fist, hoping the contrast with his shrewder nephew Feyd-Rautha will make the latter popular among the people of Arrakis when he eventually replaces Rabban. The Emperor, suspecting the Baron of trying to create troops more powerful than the Sardaukar to seize power, sends spies to Arrakis. Thufir uses the opportunity to sow seeds of doubt in the Baron about the Emperor's true plans, putting further strain on their alliance.Gurney, who survived the Harkonnen coup and became a smuggler, reunites with Paul and Jessica after a Fremen raid on his harvester. Believing Jessica to be a traitor, Gurney threatens to kill her but is stopped by Paul. Paul did not foresee Gurney's attack and concludes he must increase his prescience by drinking the Water of Life, which is fatal to males. Paul falls into unconsciousness for three weeks after drinking the poison, but when he wakes, he has clairvoyance across time and space: he is the Kwisatz Haderach, the ultimate goal of the Bene Gesserit breeding program.Paul senses the Emperor and the Baron are amassing fleets around Arrakis to quell the Fremen rebellion, and prepares the Fremen for a major offensive. The Emperor arrives with the Baron on Arrakis. The Sardaukar seize a Fremen outpost, killing many, including young Leto, while Alia is captured and taken to the Emperor. Under cover of an electric storm, which shorts out the Sardaukar's defensive shields, Paul and the Fremen, riding giant sandworms, destroy the capital's natural rock fortifications with atomics and attack, while Alia assassinates the Baron and escapes. The Fremen quickly defeat both the Harkonnen and Sardaukar troops, killing Rabban in the process. Thufir is ordered to assassinate Paul, who gives him the opportunity to take anything that Thufir wishes of him. Thufir chooses to stab himself with the poisoned needle intended for Paul.Paul faces the Emperor, threatening to destroy spice production forever unless Shaddam abdicates the throne. Feyd-Rautha challenges Paul to a knife fight, during which he cheats and tries to kill Paul with a poison spur in his belt. Paul gains the upper hand and kills him. The Emperor reluctantly cedes the throne to Paul and promises his daughter Princess Irulan's hand in marriage. Paul takes control of the Empire, but realizes that he cannot stop the Fremen jihad, as their belief in him is too powerful to restrain.The Dune series is a landmark of science fiction. Herbert deliberately suppressed technology in his Dune universe so he could address the politics of humanity, rather than the future of humanity's technology. For example, a key pre-history event to the novel's present is the \"Butlerian Jihad\", in which all robots and computers were destroyed, eliminating these common elements to science fiction from the novel as to allow focus on humanity.[14]Dune considers the way humans and their institutions might change over time.[1] Director John Harrison, who adapted Dune for Syfy's 2000 miniseries, called the novel a universal and timeless reflection of \"the human condition and its moral dilemmas\", and said:But Dune has also been called a mix of soft and hard science fiction since \"the attention to ecology is hard, the anthropology and the psychic abilities are soft.\"[18] Hard elements include the ecology of Arrakis, suspensor technology, weapon systems, and ornithopters, while soft elements include issues relating to religion, physical and mental training, cultures, politics, and psychology.[19]Herbert said Paul's messiah figure was inspired by the Arthurian legend,[20] and that the scarcity of water on Arrakis was a metaphor for oil, as well as air and water itself, and for the shortages of resources caused by overpopulation.[21] Novelist Brian Herbert, his son and biographer, wrote:Each chapter of Dune begins with an epigraph excerpted from the fictional writings of the character Princess Irulan. In forms such as diary entries, historical commentary, biography, quotations and philosophy, these writings set tone and provide exposition, context and other details intended to enhance understanding of Herbert's complex fictional universe and themes.[23][24][25] They act as foreshadowing and invite the reader to keep reading to close the gap between what the epigraph says and what is happening in the main narrative.[26] The epigraphs also give the reader the feeling that the world they are reading about is epically distanced, since Irulan writes about an idealized image of Paul as if he had already passed into memory.[27] Brian Herbert wrote: \"Dad told me that you could follow any of the novel's layers as you read it, and then start the book all over again, focusing on an entirely different layer. At the end of the book, he intentionally left loose ends and said he did this to send the readers spinning out of the story with bits and pieces of it still clinging to them, so that they would want to go back and read it again.\"[28]Middle-Eastern and Islamic references\n[edit]Due to the similarities between some of Herbert's terms and ideas and actual words and concepts in the Arabic language, as well as the series' \"Islamic undertones\" and themes, a Middle-Eastern influence on Herbert's works has been noted repeatedly.[29][30] In his descriptions of the Fremen culture and language, Herbert uses both authentic Arabic words and Arabic-sounding words.[31][32] For example, one of the names for the sandworm, Shai-hulud, is derived from شيء خلود, šayʾ ḫulūd, 'immortal thing' or شيخ خلود, šayḫ ḫulūd, 'old man of eternity'.[32][33] The title of the Fremen housekeeper, the Shadout Mapes, is borrowed from the شادوف, šādūf, the Egyptian term for a device used to raise water.[32] In particular, words related to the messianic religion of the Fremen, first implanted by the Bene Gesserit, are taken from Arabic, including Muad'Dib (from مؤدب, muʾaddib, 'educator'), Lisan al-Gaib (from لسان الغيب, lisān al-ġayb, 'voice of the unseen'), Usul (from أصول, ʾuṣūl, 'fundamental principles'), Shari-a (from شريعة, šarīʿa, 'sharia; path'), Shaitan (from شيطان, šayṭān, 'Shaitan; devil; fiend'), and jinn (from جن, ǧinn, 'jinn; spirit; demon; mythical being').[29] It is likely Herbert relied on second-hand resources such as phrasebooks and desert adventure stories to find these Arabic words and phrases for the Fremen.[32] They are meaningful and carefully chosen, and help create an \"imagined desert culture that resonates with exotic sounds, enigmas, and pseudo-Islamic references\" and has a distinctly Bedouin aesthetic.[32]As a foreigner who adopts the ways of a desert-dwelling people and then leads them in a military capacity, Paul Atreides bears many similarities to the historical T. E. Lawrence.[34] His 1962 biopic Lawrence of Arabia has also been identified as a potential influence.[35]The Sabres of Paradise (1960) has also been identified as a potential influence upon Dune, with its depiction of Imam Shamil and the Islamic culture of the Caucasus inspiring some of the themes, characters, events and terminology of Dune.[8]The environment of the desert planet Arrakis was primarily inspired by the environments of the Middle East. Similarly Arrakis as a bioregion is presented as a particular kind of political site. Herbert has made it resemble a desertified petrostate area.[36] The Fremen people of Arrakis were influenced by the Bedouin tribes of Arabia, and the Mahdi prophecy originates from Islamic eschatology.[37] Inspiration is also adopted from medieval historian Ibn Khaldun's cyclical history and his dynastic concept in North Africa, hinted at by Herbert's reference to Khaldun's book Kitāb al-ʿibar (\"The Book of Lessons\"). The fictionalized version of the \"Kitab al-ibar\" in Dune is a combination of a Fremen religious manual and a desert survival book.[38][39]Additional language and historic influences\n[edit]In addition to Arabic, Dune derives words and names from a variety of other languages, including Navajo, Latin, Old Scandinavian (\"Landsraad\"),[40]Romani, Hebrew (\"Kefitzat haderech\", קפיצת הדרך, contracting of the path), Serbo-Croatian, Nahuatl, Greek, Persian, Sanskrit (\"prana bindu\", \"prajna\"), Russian, Turkish, Finnish, and Old English.[41][42]Bene Gesserit is part of the Latin legal phrase quamdiu se bene gesserit \"as long as he shall behave himself well\" seen in grants of certain offices (such as judgeships) meaning that the appointee shall remain in office so long as he shall not be guilty of abusing it. Some critics miss the connotation of the phrase, misled by the Latin future perfect gesserit, taking it over-literally (and adding an unwarranted passive) to mean \"it will have been well borne\", an interpretation which is not well supported by the Bene Gesserit doctrine in the story.[43][original research?]Through the inspiration from The Sabres of Paradise, there are also allusions to the tsarist-era Russian nobility and Cossacks.[44] Frank Herbert stated that bureaucracy that lasted long enough would become a hereditary nobility, and a significant theme behind the aristocratic families in Dune was \"aristocratic bureaucracy\" which he saw as analogous to the Soviet Union.[45][46]Environmentalism and ecology\n[edit]Dune has been called the \"first planetary ecology novel on a grand scale\".[47] Herbert hoped it would be seen as an \"environmental awareness handbook\" and said the title was meant to \"echo the sound of 'doom'\".[48] It was reviewed in the best-selling countercultural Whole Earth Catalog in 1968 as a \"rich re-readable fantasy with clear portrayal of the fierce environment it takes to cohere a community\".[49]After the publication of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson in 1962, science fiction writers began treating the subject of ecological change and its consequences. Dune responded in 1965 with its complex descriptions of Arrakis life, from giant sandworms (for whom water is deadly) to smaller, mouse-like life-forms adapted to live with limited water. Dune was followed in its creation of complex and unique ecologies by other science fiction books such as A Door into Ocean (1986) and Red Mars (1992).[47] Environmentalists have pointed out that Dune's popularity as a novel depicting a planet as a complex—almost living—thing, in combination with the first images of Earth from space being published in the same time period, strongly influenced environmental movements such as the establishment of the international Earth Day.[50]While the genre of climate fiction was popularized in the 2010s in response to real global climate change, Dune as well as other early science fiction works from authors like J. G. Ballard (The Drowned World) and Kim Stanley Robinson (the Mars trilogy) have retroactively been considered pioneering examples of the genre.[51][52]Declining empires\n[edit]The Imperium in Dune contains features of various empires in Europe and the Near East, including the Roman Empire, Holy Roman Empire, and Ottoman Empire.[33][53][54] Lorenzo DiTommaso compared Dune's portrayal of the downfall of a galactic empire to Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which argues that Christianity allied with the profligacy of the Roman elite led to the fall of Ancient Rome. In \"The Articulation of Imperial Decadence and Decline in Epic Science Fiction\" (2007), DiTommaso outlines similarities between the two works by highlighting the excesses of the Emperor on his home planet of Kaitain and of the Baron Harkonnen in his palace. The Emperor loses his effectiveness as a ruler through an excess of ceremony and pomp. The hairdressers and attendants he brings with him to Arrakis are even referred to as \"parasites\". The Baron Harkonnen is similarly corrupt and materially indulgent. Gibbon's Decline and Fall partly blames the fall of Rome on the rise of Christianity. Gibbon claimed that this exotic import from a conquered province weakened the soldiers of Rome and left it open to attack. The Emperor's Sardaukar fighters are little match for the Fremen of Dune not only because of the Sardaukar's overconfidence and the fact that Jessica and Paul have trained the Fremen in their battle tactics, but because of the Fremen's capacity for self-sacrifice. The Fremen put the community before themselves in every instance, while the world outside wallows in luxury at the expense of others.[55]The decline and long peace of the Empire sets the stage for revolution and renewal by genetic mixing of successful and unsuccessful groups through war, a process culminating in the Jihad led by Paul Atreides, described by Frank Herbert as depicting \"war as a collective orgasm\" (drawing on Norman Walter's 1950 The Sexual Cycle of Human Warfare),[56][57] themes that would reappear in God Emperor of Dune's Scattering and Leto II's all-female Fish Speaker army.Gender dynamics\n[edit]Gender dynamics are complex in Dune. Herbert offers a multi-layered portrayal of gender roles within the context of a feudal, hierarchical society, particularly through the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood. Although the Bene Gesserit tend to hold roles that are traditionally associated with women, such as wives, concubines, and mothers, their characters transcend stereotypes as they play politics and pursue long-term strategic goals. Full gender equality is not depicted in Dune, but the Bene Gesserit use specialized training and access to high-ranking men to gain agency and power within the constraints of their environment. Their training in prana-bindu allows them to exert control over their minds and bodies, including over pregnancy, and they are skilled in hand-to-hand combat and use of the Voice to command others. Jessica's disobedience in bearing a son instead of daughter and training him in the Bene Gesserit Way is a major plot point that sets in motion the events of the novel.[58][59] By setting up certain women with leaders of certain Houses in the Imperium, the Bene Gesserit can control bloodlines across generations through their secret breeding program.[60] Even within the male-dominated Imperium, then, the Bene Gesserit wield reproductive power and choose which genetic markers to continue into the future.[61]Reverend Mother Mohiam uses skills in Truthsaying to act as the Emperor's official Truthsayer and advisor. Her role can be considered similar to that of abbesses in the medieval Church. Before Princess Irulan appears as a character who agrees to a political marriage with Paul, she acts as a historian who shapes the reader's interpretation of the story and Paul's legacy due to the excerpts from her writing that frame each chapter.[58][59]Among the Fremen, women have roles as mothers and wives and also exercise agency through combat and religious authority. Fremen women and children have a reputation for being just as violent and dangerous as Fremen men. Chani travels with Stilgar in his military party, armed like the others. After becoming Paul's concubine, she kills one of the men who comes to challenge him. Alia leads an attack against the Emperor's Sardaukar and kills Baron Harkonnen with a gom jabbar. Women also take on the role of religious leaders. Chani is a Sayyadina who presides over tribal rituals such as Paul's worm-riding test, and Reverend Mother Ramallo carries the tribe's memories and passes them along to Jessica through the Water of Life ceremony. Within the male-led sietches, Fremen women find different avenues of authority.[62]The gom jabbar test of humanity is administered by the female Bene Gesserit order but rarely to males.[63] The Bene Gesserit have seemingly mastered the unconscious and can play on the unconscious weaknesses of others using the Voice, yet their breeding program seeks after a male Kwisatz Haderach.[34] Their plan is to produce a male who can \"possess complete racial memory, both male and female,\" and look into the black hole in the collective unconscious that they fear.[64] A central theme of the book is the connection, in Jessica's son, of this female aspect with his male aspect. This aligns with concepts in Jungian psychology, which features conscious/unconscious and taking/giving roles associated with males and females, as well as the idea of the collective unconscious.[65] Paul's approach to power consistently requires his upbringing under the matriarchal Bene Gesserit, who operate as a long-dominating shadow government behind all of the great houses and their marriages or divisions.[64] He is trained by Jessica in the Bene Gesserit Way, which includes prana-bindu training in nerve and muscle control and precise perception.[59] Paul also receives Mentat training, thus helping prepare him to be a type of androgynous Kwisatz Haderach, a male Reverend Mother.[64]In a Bene Gesserit test early in the book, it is implied that people are generally \"inhuman\" in that they irrationally place desire over self-interest and reason.[citation needed] This applies Herbert's philosophy that humans are not created equal, while equal justice and equal opportunity are higher ideals than mental, physical, or moral equality.[66]Heroism\n[edit]Throughout Paul's rise to superhuman status, he follows a plotline common to many stories describing the birth of a hero.[68] He has unfortunate circumstances forced onto him. After a long period of hardship and exile, he confronts and defeats the source of evil in his tale.[69][70] As such, Dune is representative of a general trend beginning in 1960s American science fiction in that it features a character who attains godlike status through scientific means.[71] Eventually, Paul Atreides gains a level of omniscience which allows him to take over the planet and the galaxy, and causes the Fremen of Arrakis to worship him like a god. Author Frank Herbert said in 1979, \"The bottom line of the Dune trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better to rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes.\"[72] He wrote in 1985, \"Dune was aimed at this whole idea of the infallible leader because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader (or made in a leader's name) are amplified by the numbers who follow without question.\"[73]Juan A. Prieto-Pablos says Herbert achieves a new typology with Paul's superpowers, differentiating the heroes of Dune from earlier heroes such as Superman, van Vogt's Gilbert Gosseyn and Henry Kuttner's telepaths. Unlike previous superheroes who acquire their powers suddenly and accidentally, Paul's are the result of \"painful and slow personal progress.\" And unlike other superheroes of the 1960s—who are the exception among ordinary people in their respective worlds—Herbert's characters grow their powers through \"the application of mystical philosophies and techniques.\" For Herbert, the ordinary person can develop incredible fighting skills (Fremen, Ginaz swordsmen and Sardaukar) or mental abilities (Bene Gesserit, Mentats, Spacing Guild Navigators).[74]Zen and religion\n[edit]Main article: List of Dune religionsEarly in his newspaper career, Herbert was introduced to Zen by two Jungian psychologists, Ralph and Irene Slattery, who \"gave a crucial boost to his thinking\".[75] Zen teachings ultimately had \"a profound and continuing influence on [Herbert's] work\".[75] Throughout the Dune series and particularly in Dune, Herbert employs concepts and forms borrowed from Zen Buddhism.[75][76] The Fremen are referred to as Zensunni adherents, and many of Herbert's epigraphs are Zen-spirited.[77] In \"Dune Genesis\", Frank Herbert wrote:Brian Herbert called the Dune universe \"a spiritual melting pot\", noting that his father incorporated elements of a variety of religions, including Buddhism, Sufi mysticism and other Islamic belief systems, Catholicism, Protestantism, Judaism, and Hinduism.[78] He added that Frank Herbert's fictional future in which \"religious beliefs have combined into interesting forms\" represents the author's solution to eliminating arguments between religions, each of which claimed to have \"the one and only revelation.\"[78][79]Asimov's Foundation\n[edit]Tim O'Reilly suggests that Herbert also wrote Dune as a counterpoint to Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. In his monograph on Frank Herbert, O'Reilly wrote that \"Dune is clearly a commentary on the Foundation trilogy. Herbert has taken a look at the same imaginative situation that provoked Asimov's classic—the decay of a galactic empire—and restated it in a way that draws on different assumptions and suggests radically different conclusions. The twist he has introduced into Dune is that the Mule, not the Foundation, is his hero.\"[80] According to O'Reilly, Herbert bases the Bene Gesserit on the scientific shamans of the Foundation, though they use biological rather than statistical science.[80] In contrast to the Foundation series and its praise of science and rationality, Dune proposes that the unconscious and unexpected are actually what are needed for humanity.[80]Both Herbert and Asimov explore the implications of prescience (i.e., visions of the future) both psychologically and socially. The Foundation series deploys a broadly determinist approach to prescient vision rooted in mathematical reasoning on a macroscopic social level. Dune, by contrast, invents a biologically rooted power of prescience that becomes determinist when the user actively relies on it to navigate past an undefined threshold of detail. Herbert's eugenically produced and spice-enhanced prescience is also personalized to individual actors whose roles in later books constrain each other's visions, rendering the future more or less mutable as time progresses. In what might be a comment on Foundation, Herbert's most powerfully prescient being in God Emperor of Dune laments the boredom engendered by prescience, and values surprises, especially regarding one's death, as a psychological necessity.[citation needed]However, both works contain a similar theme of the restoration of civilization[81] and seem to make the fundamental assumption that \"political maneuvering, the need to control material resources, and friendship or mating bonds will be fundamentally the same in the future as they are now.\"[82]Dune tied with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo Award in 1966[83] and won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel.[84] Reviews of the novel have been largely positive, and Dune is considered by some critics to be the best science fiction book ever written.[85] The novel has been translated into dozens of languages, and has sold almost 20 million copies.[86]Dune has been regularly cited as one of the world's best-selling science fiction novels.[3][87]Arthur C. Clarke described Dune as \"unique\" and wrote, \"I know nothing comparable to it except The Lord of the Rings.\"[88]Robert A. Heinlein described the novel as \"powerful, convincing, and most ingenious.\"[88][89] It was described as \"one of the monuments of modern science fiction\" by the Chicago Tribune,[88] and P. Schuyler Miller called Dune \"one of the landmarks of modern science fiction ... an amazing feat of creation.\"[89]The Washington Post described it as \"a portrayal of an alien society more complete and deeply detailed than any other author in the field has managed ... a story absorbing equally for its action and philosophical vistas ... An astonishing science fiction phenomenon.\"[88][89]Algis Budrys praised Dune for the vividness of its imagined setting, saying \"The time lives. It breathes, it speaks, and Herbert has smelt it in his nostrils\". He found that the novel, however, \"turns flat and tails off at the end. ... [T]ruly effective villains simply simper and melt; fierce men and cunning statesmen and seeresses all bend before this new Messiah\". Budrys faulted in particular Herbert's decision to kill Paul's infant son offstage, with no apparent emotional impact, saying \"you cannot be so busy saving a world that you cannot hear an infant shriek\".[90] After criticizing unrealistic science fiction, Carl Sagan in 1978 listed Dune as among stories \"that are so tautly constructed, so rich in the accommodating details of an unfamiliar society that they sweep me along before I have even a chance to be critical\".[91]The Louisville Times wrote, \"Herbert's creation of this universe, with its intricate development and analysis of ecology, religion, politics, and philosophy, remains one of the supreme and seminal achievements in science fiction.\"[89] Writing for The New Yorker, Jon Michaud praised Herbert's \"clever authorial decision\" to exclude robots and computers (\"two staples of the genre\") from his fictional universe, but suggested that this may be one explanation why Dune lacks \"true fandom among science-fiction fans\" to the extent that it \"has not penetrated popular culture in the way that The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars have\".[14] Tamara I. Hladik wrote that the story \"crafts a universe where lesser novels promulgate excuses for sequels. All its rich elements are in balance and plausible—not the patchwork confederacy of made-up languages, contrived customs, and meaningless histories that are the hallmark of so many other, lesser novels.\"[92]On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed Dune on its list of the 100 most influential novels.[93]J. R. R. Tolkien refused to review Dune, on the grounds that he disliked it \"with some intensity\" and thus felt it would be unfair to Herbert, another working author, if he gave an honest review of the book.[94]The first edition of Dune is one of the most valuable in science fiction book collecting. Copies have been sold for more than $20,000 at auction.[95]California State University, Fullerton's Pollak Library has several of Herbert's draft manuscripts of Dune and other works, with the author's notes, in their Frank Herbert Archives.[96]See also: Dune (franchise) § Development and publicationAfter Dune proved to be a critical and financial success for Herbert, he was able to devote himself full time to writing additional novels in the series. He had already drafted parts of the second and third while writing Dune.[14] The series included Dune Messiah (1969), Children of Dune (1976), God Emperor of Dune (1981), Heretics of Dune (1984), and Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), each sequentially continuing on the narrative from Dune. Herbert died on February 11, 1986.[97]Herbert's son, Brian Herbert, had found several thousand pages of notes left by his father that outlined ideas for other narratives related to Dune. Brian Herbert enlisted author Kevin J. Anderson to help build out prequel novels to the events of Dune. Brian Herbert's and Anderson's Dune prequels first started publication in 1999, and have led to additional stories that take place between those of Frank Herbert's books.[98] The notes for what would have been Dune 7 also enabled them to publish Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007), sequels to Frank Herbert's final novel Chapterhouse: Dune, which complete the chronological progression of his original series, and wrap up storylines that began in Heretics of Dune.Further information: Dune (franchise) § In other mediaDune has been considered an \"unfilmable\" and \"uncontainable\" work to adapt from novel to film or other visual medium.[99] Described by Wired, \"It has four appendices and a glossary of its own gibberish, and its action takes place on two planets, one of which is a desert overrun by worms the size of airport runways. Lots of important people die or try to kill each other, and they're all tethered to about eight entangled subplots.\"[100] There have been several attempts to achieve this difficult conversion with various degrees of success.[101]Early stalled attempts\n[edit]In 1971, the production company Apjac International (APJ) (headed by Arthur P. Jacobs) optioned the rights to film Dune. As Jacobs was busy with other projects, such as the sequel to Planet of the Apes, Dune was delayed for another year. Jacobs' first choice for director was David Lean, but he turned down the offer. Charles Jarrott was also considered to direct. Work was also under way on a script while the hunt for a director continued. Initially, the first treatment had been handled by Robert Greenhut, the producer who had lobbied Jacobs to make the movie in the first place, but subsequently Rospo Pallenberg was approached to write the script, with shooting scheduled to begin in 1974. However, Jacobs died in 1973.[102]In December 1974, a French consortium led by Jean-Paul Gibon purchased the film rights from APJ, with Alejandro Jodorowsky set to direct.[103] In 1975, Jodorowsky planned to film the story as a 3-hour feature, set to star his own son Brontis Jodorowsky in the lead role of Paul Atreides, Salvador Dalí as Shaddam IV, Padishah Emperor, Amanda Lear as Princess Irulan, Orson Welles as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, Gloria Swanson as Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, David Carradine as Duke Leto Atreides, Geraldine Chaplin as Lady Jessica, Alain Delon as Duncan Idaho, Hervé Villechaize as Gurney Halleck, Udo Kier as Piter De Vries, and Mick Jagger as Feyd-Rautha. It was at first proposed to score the film with original music by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Henry Cow, and Magma; later on, the soundtrack was to be provided by Pink Floyd.[104] Jodorowsky set up a pre-production unit in Paris consisting of Chris Foss, a British artist who designed covers for science fiction periodicals, Jean Giraud (Moebius), a French illustrator who created and also wrote and drew for Metal Hurlant magazine, and H. R. Giger.[103] Moebius began designing creatures and characters for the film, while Foss was brought in to design the film's space ships and hardware.[103] Giger began designing the Harkonnen Castle based on Moebius's storyboards. Dan O'Bannon was to head the special effects department.[103]Dalí was cast as the Emperor.[103] Dalí later demanded to be paid $100,000 per hour; Jodorowsky agreed, but tailored Dalí's part to be filmed in one hour, drafting plans for other scenes of the emperor to use a mechanical mannequin as substitute for Dalí.[103] According to Giger, Dalí was \"later invited to leave the film because of his pro-Franco statements\".[105] Just as the storyboards, designs, and script were finished, the financial backing dried up. Frank Herbert traveled to Europe in 1976 to find that $2 million of the $9.5 million budget had already been spent in pre-production, and that Jodorowsky's script would result in a 14-hour movie (\"It was the size of a phone book\", Herbert later recalled). Jodorowsky took creative liberties with the source material, but Herbert said that he and Jodorowsky had an amicable relationship. Jodorowsky said in 1985 that he found the Dune story mythical and had intended to re-create it rather than adapt the novel; though he had an \"enthusiastic admiration\" for Herbert, Jodorowsky said he had done everything possible to distance the author and his input from the project.[103] Although Jodorowsky was embittered by the experience, he said the Dune project changed his life, and some of the ideas were used in his and Moebius's The Incal.[106] O'Bannon entered a psychiatric hospital after the production failed, then worked on 13 scripts, the last of which became Alien.[103] A 2013 documentary, Jodorowsky's Dune, was made about Jodorowsky's failed attempt at an adaptation.In 1976, Dino De Laurentiis acquired the rights from Gibon's consortium. De Laurentiis commissioned Herbert to write a new screenplay in 1978; the script Herbert turned in was 175 pages long, the equivalent of nearly three hours of screen time. De Laurentiis then hired director Ridley Scott in 1979, with Rudy Wurlitzer writing the screenplay and H. R. Giger retained from the Jodorowsky production; Scott and Giger had also just worked together on the film Alien, after O'Bannon recommended the artist.[107][108] Scott intended to split the novel into two movies. He worked on three drafts of the script, using The Battle of Algiers as a point of reference, before moving on to direct another science fiction film, Blade Runner (1982). As he recalls, the pre-production process was slow, and finishing the project would have been even more time-intensive:A draft of the screenplay for the Scott version was discovered in 2024 in the Wheaton College archives.[109]1984 film by David Lynch\n[edit]Main article: Dune (1984 film)In 1981, the nine-year film rights were set to expire. De Laurentiis re-negotiated the rights from the author, adding to them the rights to the Dune sequels (written and unwritten). After seeing The Elephant Man, De Laurentiis' daughter Raffaella decided that David Lynch should direct the movie. Around that time Lynch received several other directing offers, including Return of the Jedi. He agreed to direct Dune and write the screenplay even though he had not read the book, was not familiar with the story, or even been interested in science fiction.[110] Lynch worked on the script for six months with Eric Bergren and Christopher De Vore. The team yielded two drafts of the script before it split over creative differences. Lynch would subsequently work on five more drafts. Production of the work was troubled by problems at the Mexican studio and hampering the film's timeline.[111] Lynch ended up producing a nearly three-hour-long film, but at demands from Universal Pictures, the film's distributor, he cut it back to about two hours, hastily filming additional scenes to make up for some of the cut footage.[112]This first film of Dune, directed by Lynch, was released in 1984, nearly 20 years after the book's publication. Though Herbert said the book's depth and symbolism seemed to intimidate many filmmakers, he was pleased with the film, saying that \"They've got it. It begins as Dune does. And I hear my dialogue all the way through. There are some interpretations and liberties, but you're gonna come out knowing you've seen Dune.\"[113] Reviews of the film were negative, saying that it was incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book, and that fans would be disappointed by the way it strayed from the book's plot.[99][114][115][116][117] Upon release for television and other forms of home media, Universal opted to reintroduce much of the footage that Lynch had cut, creating an over-three-hour-long version with extensive monologue exposition. Lynch was extremely displeased with this move, and demanded that Universal replace his name on these cuts with the pseudonym \"Alan Smithee\", and has generally distanced himself from the film since.[112]2000 miniseries by John Harrison\n[edit]Main article: Frank Herbert's DuneIn 2000, John Harrison adapted the novel into Frank Herbert's Dune, a miniseries that premiered on the Sci-Fi Channel.[17] As of 2004, the miniseries was one of the three highest-rated programs broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel.[118]Further film attempts\n[edit]In 2008, Paramount Pictures announced that they would produce a new film based on the book, with Peter Berg attached to direct.[119] Producer Kevin Misher, who spent a year securing the rights from the Herbert estate, was to be joined by Richard Rubinstein and John Harrison (of both Sci-Fi Channel miniseries) as well as Sarah Aubrey and Mike Messina.[119] The producers stated that they were going for a \"faithful adaptation\" of the novel and considered \"its theme of finite ecological resources particularly timely\".[119] Science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson and Frank Herbert's son Brian Herbert, who had together written multiple Dune sequels and prequels since 1999, were attached to the project as technical advisors.[120] In October 2009, Berg dropped out of the project, later saying that it \"for a variety of reasons wasn't the right thing\" for him.[121] Subsequently, with a script draft by Joshua Zetumer, Paramount reportedly sought a new director who could do the film for under $175 million.[122] In 2010, Pierre Morel was signed on to direct, with screenwriter Chase Palmer incorporating Morel's vision of the project into Zetumer's original draft.[123][124] By November 2010, Morel left the project.[125] Paramount finally dropped plans for a remake in March 2011.[126]Films by Denis Villeneuve\n[edit]Main articles: Dune (2021 film) and Dune: Part TwoIn November 2016, Legendary Entertainment acquired the film and TV rights for Dune.[127][128]Variety reported in December 2016 that Denis Villeneuve was in negotiations to direct the project,[129] which was confirmed in February 2017.[130] In April 2017, Legendary announced that Eric Roth would write the screenplay.[131] Villeneuve explained in March 2018 that his adaptation will be split into two films, with the first installment scheduled to begin production in 2019.[132] Casting includes Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides,[133]Dave Bautista as Rabban, Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Harkonnen,[134]Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica,[135]Charlotte Rampling as Reverend Mother Mohiam,[136]Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto Atreides,[137]Zendaya as Chani,[138]Javier Bardem as Stilgar,[139]Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck,[140]Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho,[141]David Dastmalchian as Piter De Vries,[142]Chang Chen as Dr. Yueh,[143] and Stephen Henderson as Thufir Hawat.[144]Warner Bros. Pictures distributed the film, which had its initial premiere on September 3, 2021, at the Venice Film Festival,[145] and wide release in both theaters and streaming on HBO Max on October 21, 2021, as part of Warner Bros.' approach to handling the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry.[146][147] The film received \"generally favorable reviews\" on Metacritic.[148] It has gone on to win multiple awards and was named by the National Board of Review as one of the 10 best films of 2021, as well as the American Film Institute in their annual top 10 list.[149] The film went on to be nominated for ten Academy Awards, winning six, the most wins of the night for any film in contention.[150]A sequel, Dune: Part Two, was scheduled for release on November 3, 2023,[151] but was released on March 1, 2024, due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[152] It had its world premiere at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square, London, on February 15, 2024, and opened in the United States on March 1. It received critical acclaim especially for its visual effects and has grossed over $711 million worldwide, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2024.Audiobooks\n[edit]In 1993, Recorded Books Inc. released a 20-disc audiobook narrated by George Guidall. In 2007, Audio Renaissance released an audio book narrated by Simon Vance with some parts performed by Scott Brick, Orlagh Cassidy, Euan Morton, and other performers.Dune has been widely influential, inspiring numerous novels, music, films, television, games, and comic books.[153] It is considered one of the most influential science fiction novels of all time, with numerous modern science fiction works owing their existence to Dune.[citation needed] Dune has been referenced in numerous works of popular culture, including Star Wars, Star Trek, Chronicles of Riddick, The Kingkiller Chronicle and Futurama.[154]Dune was cited as a source of inspiration for Hayao Miyazaki's anime film Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984) for its post-apocalyptic world.[155][156][157][158][159]Dune was parodied in 1984's National Lampoon's Doon by Ellis Weiner, which William F. Touponce called \"something of a tribute to Herbert's success on college campuses\", noting that \"the only other book to have been so honored is Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings,\" which was parodied by The Harvard Lampoon in 1969.[160]Music\n[edit]Games\n[edit]Further information: List of games based on DuneThere have been a number of games based on the book, starting with the strategy–adventure game Dune (1992). The most important game adaptation is Dune II (1992), which established the conventions of modern real-time strategy games and is considered to be among the most influential video games of all time.[184]The online game Lost Souls includes Dune-derived elements, including sandworms and melange—addiction to which can produce psychic talents.[185] The 2016 game Enter the Gungeon features the spice melange as a random item which gives the player progressively stronger abilities and penalties with repeated uses, mirroring the long-term effects melange has on users.[186]Rick Priestley cites Dune as a major influence on his 1987 wargame, Warhammer 40,000.[187]In 2023, Funcom announced Dune: Awakening, an upcoming massively multiplayer online game set in the universe of Dune.[188][189][190]Space exploration\n[edit]The Apollo 15 astronauts named a small crater on Earth's Moon after the novel during the 1971 mission,[191] and the name was formally adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1973.[192] Since 2009, the names of planets from the Dune novels have been adopted for the real-world nomenclature of plains and other features on Saturn's moon Titan, like Arrakis Planitia.[193][194][195]^ a b .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}Hanson, Matt (2005).

{"title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory","author":"Roald Dahl","published":1964,"fiction":true,"plot":"Charlie Bucket is a kind and loving boy who lives in poverty with his parents and grandparents in a town which is home to the world-famous Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. One day, Charlie's bedridden Grandpa Joe tells him about Willy Wonka, the factory's eccentric owner, and all of his fantastical candies. Rival chocolatiers sent in spies to steal Wonka's recipes, forcing him to close the factory and disappear. Wonka reopened the factory years later, but the gates remain locked, and nobody knows who is providing the factory with its workforce as no people are seen leaving nor coming in.The next day, the newspaper announces that Wonka has hidden five Golden Tickets in Wonka Bars; the finders of these tickets will be invited to a tour of the factory. The first four tickets are found by gluttonous Augustus Gloop, spoiled Veruca Salt, compulsive gum-chewer Violet Beauregarde, and television addict Mike Teavee. During the mad rush to find the Golden Tickets, Charlie's attempts to find a Golden Ticket are met with failure: on the first try, during Charlie's birthday, his parents give him a Wonka bar (his usual birthday present) that turns out nothing; on the second try, with encouragement from Grandpa Joe, Charlie buys another Wonka bar using some of Grandpa Joe's secret savings, but that too reveals no golden ticket. One day, several days after his father loses his job at the toothpaste factory that goes bust, Charlie buys two Wonka Bars with some money he found in the snow. When he opens the second, Charlie discovers that the second bar he bought contains the fifth and final ticket. Upon hearing the news, Grandpa Joe suddenly regains his mobility and volunteers to accompany Charlie to the factory.On the day of the tour the very next day, Wonka welcomes the five children and their adult guardians inside the factory, a wonderland of confectionery creations that defy explanation. They also meet the Oompa-Loompas, a race of impish humanoids who help him operate the factory as a thanks for his rescuing them from a land of dangerous monsters and with his promise to provide them with cocoa beans. During the tour, the four other children give in to their impulses and are ejected from the tour in darkly comical ways: Augustus falls into the Chocolate River and is sucked up a pipe, Violet turns blue and inflates into a giant human blueberry after chewing an experimental stick of three-course dinner gum ending with a blueberry pie flavor, Veruca and her parents fall down a garbage chute after the former tries to capture one of the nut-testing squirrels, and Mike is shrunk down to the size of a chocolate bar after misusing a machine that sends chocolate by television despite Wonka's warnings. The Oompa-Loompas sing about the children's misbehavior each time disaster strikes.With only Charlie remaining, Wonka congratulates him for \"winning\" the factory. Wonka explains that the whole tour was actually secretly designed to help him find a worthy heir to his business, and Charlie was the only child whose innocence and good nature passed the test. They ride the Great Glass Elevator and watch the other four children leave the factory by boarding trucks loaded to the brim with Wonka products (as promised in the Golden Tickets) before flying to Charlie's house, where Wonka invites the entire Bucket family to come and live with him inside his factory.Main article: List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory charactersRace, editing, and censorship\n[edit]See also: Roald Dahl revision controversyDahl's widow said that Charlie was originally written as \"a little black boy though this thought to be a falsehood.\" Dahl's biographer said the change to a white character was driven by Dahl's agent, who thought a black Charlie would not appeal to readers.[10][11]In the first published edition, the Oompa-Loompas were described as African pygmies, and were drawn this way in the original printed edition.[10] After the announcement of a film adaptation sparked a statement from the NAACP, which expressed concern that the transportation of Oompa-Loompas to Wonka's factory resembled slavery, Dahl found himself sympathising with their concerns and published a revised edition.[10] In this edition, as well as the subsequent sequel, the Oompa-Loompas were drawn as being white and appearing similar to hippies, and the references to Africa were deleted.[10]In 2023, publisher Puffin made more than eighty additional changes to the original text of the book, such as: removing every occurrence of the word fat (including referring to Augustus Gloop as \"enormous\" rather than \"enormously fat\" and greatly changing the words of his song); removing most references to the Oompa-Loompa's diminutive size and physical appearance and omitting descriptions of them living in trees and wearing deerskins and leaves; removing or changing the words mad, crazy, and queer; omitting many references to Mike Teavee's toy guns; and removing references to corporal punishment (such as changing \"She needs a really good spanking\" to \"She needs a really good talking to\" and \"She wants a good kick in the pants\" to \"She needs to learn some manners\").[12][13]Unused chapters\n[edit]Various unused and draft material from Dahl's early versions of the novel have been found. In the initial, unpublished drafts of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory nine golden tickets were distributed to tour Willy Wonka's secret chocolate factory[15] and the children faced more rooms and more temptations to test their self-control.[15][16] Some of the names of the children cut from the final work include:[17]\"Spotty Powder\"\n[edit]\"Spotty Powder\" was first published as a short story in 1973.[21][23] In 1998, it was included in the children's horror anthology Scary! Stories That Will Make You Scream edited by Peter Haining. The brief note before the story described the story as having been left out of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory due to an already brimming number of misbehaving children characters in the tale. In 2005, The Times reprinted \"Spotty Powder\" as a \"lost\" chapter, saying that it had been found in Dahl's desk, written backwards in mirror writing (the same way that Leonardo da Vinci wrote in his journals).[16][24] Spotty Powder looks and tastes like sugar, but causes bright red pox-like spots to appear on faces and necks five seconds after ingestion, so children who eat Spotty Powder do not have to go to school. The spots fade on their own a few hours later. After learning the purpose of Spotty Powder, the humourless, smug Miranda Piker and her equally humourless father (a schoolmaster) are enraged and disappear into the Spotty Powder room to sabotage the machine. Soon after entering, they are heard making what Mrs. Piker interprets as screams. Mr. Wonka assures her (after making a brief joke where he claims that headmasters are one of the occasional ingredients) that it is only laughter. Exactly what happens to them is not revealed in the extract.[15][16]In an early draft, sometime after being renamed from Miranda Grope to Miranda Piker, but before \"Spotty Powder\" was written, she falls down the chocolate waterfall and ends up in the Peanut-Brittle Mixer. This results in the \"rude and disobedient little kid\" becoming \"quite delicious.\"[21][25] This early draft poem was slightly rewritten as an Oompa-Loompa song in the lost chapter, which now puts her in the \"Spotty-Powder mixer\" and instead of being \"crunchy and ... good [peanut brittle]\" she is now \"useful [for truancy] and ... good.\"[16]\"The Vanilla Fudge Room\"\n[edit]In 2014, The Guardian revealed that Dahl had removed another chapter (\"The Vanilla Fudge Room\") from an early draft of the book. The Guardian reported the now-eliminated passage was \"deemed too wild, subversive and insufficiently moral for the tender minds of British children almost 50 years ago.\"[15] In what was originally chapter five in that version of the book, Charlie goes to the factory with his mother instead of Grandpa Joe as originally published. At this point, the chocolate factory tour is down to eight kids,[22][26] including Tommy Troutbeck and Wilbur Rice. After the entire group climbs to the top of the titular fudge mountain, eating vanilla fudge along the way, Troutbeck and Rice decide to take a ride on the wagons carrying away chunks of fudge. The wagons take them directly to the Pounding And Cutting Room, where the fudge is reformed and sliced into small squares for retail sale. Wonka states the machine is equipped with \"a large wire strainer ... which is used specially for catching children before they fall into the machine\" adding that \"It always catches them. At least it always has up to now.\"[22]The chapter dates back to an early draft with ten golden tickets, including one each for Miranda Grope and Augustus Pottle, who fell into the chocolate river prior to the events of \"Fudge Mountain\".[15][27] Augustus Pottle was routed to the Chocolate Fudge Room, not the Vanilla Fudge Room explored in this chapter,[22][26] and Miranda Grope ended up in the Fruit and Nuts Room.\"The Warming Candy Room\"\n[edit]Also in 2014, Vanity Fair published a plot summary of \"The Warming Candy Room\", wherein three boys eat too many \"warming candies\" and end up \"bursting with heat.\"[28]The Warming Candy Room is dominated by a boiler, which heats a scarlet liquid. The liquid is dispensed one drop at a time, where it cools and forms a hard shell, storing the heat and \"by a magic process ... the hot heat changes into an amazing thing called 'cold heat.'\" After eating a single warming candy, one could stand naked in the snow comfortably. This is met with predictable disbelief from Clarence Crump, Bertie Upside, and Terence Roper, who proceed to eat at least 100 warming candies each, resulting in profuse perspiration. The three boys and their families discontinue the tour after they are taken to cool off \"in the large refrigerator for a few hours.\"[19]\"The Children's-Delight Room\"\n[edit]Dahl originally planned for a child called Marvin Prune to be included. He submitted the excised chapter regarding Prune to The Horn Book Review in the early 1970s.[29] Rather than publish the chapter, Horn Book responded with a critical essay by novelist Eleanor Cameron, who called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory “one of the most tasteless books ever written for children”.[30]In a 2006 list for the Royal Society of Literature, author J. K. Rowling (author of the Harry Potter books) named Charlie and the Chocolate Factory among her top ten books that every child should read.[31] A fan of the book since childhood, film director Tim Burton wrote: \"I responded to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory because it respected the fact that children can be adults.\"[32][33]A 2004 study found that it was a common read-aloud book for fourth-graders in schools in San Diego County, California.[34] A 2012 survey by the University of Worcester determined that it was one of the most common books that UK adults had read as children, after Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and The Wind in the Willows.[35]Groups who have praised the book include:In the 2012 survey published by SLJ, a monthly with primarily US audience, Charlie was the second of four books by Dahl among their Top 100 Chapter Books, one more than any other writer.[40]Time magazine in the US included the novel in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time; it was one of three Dahl novels on the list, more than any other author.[41] In 2016 the novel topped the list of Amazon's best-selling children's books by Dahl in Print and on Kindle.[42] In 2023, the novel was ranked by BBC at no. 18 in their poll of \"The 100 greatest children's books of all time\".[43]Although the book has always been popular and considered a children's classic by many literary critics, a number of prominent individuals have spoken unfavourably of the novel over the years.[44] Children's novelist and literary historian John Rowe Townsend has described the book as \"fantasy of an almost literally nauseating kind\" and accused it of \"astonishing insensitivity\" regarding the original portrayal of the Oompa-Loompas as African black pygmies, although Dahl did revise this in later editions.[45] Another novelist, Eleanor Cameron, compared the book to the sweets that form its subject matter, commenting that it is \"delectable and soothing while we are undergoing the brief sensory pleasure it affords but leaves us poorly nourished with our taste dulled for better fare.\"[30]Ursula K. Le Guin wrote in support of this assessment in a letter to The Horn Book Review, saying that her own daughter would turn \"quite nasty\" upon finishing the book.[46] Dahl responded to Cameron's criticisms by noting that the classics that she had cited would not be well received by contemporary children.[47]Main article: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (franchise)Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has frequently been adapted for other media, including games, radio, the screen,[48] and stage, most often as plays or musicals for children – often titled Willy Wonka or Willy Wonka, Jr. and almost always featuring musical numbers by all the main characters (Wonka, Charlie, Grandpa Joe, Violet, Veruca, etc.); many of the songs are revised versions from the 1971 film.Film\n[edit]The book was first made into a feature film as a musical, titled Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971), directed by Mel Stuart, produced by David L. Wolper, and starring Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, character actor Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, and Peter Ostrum as Charlie Bucket, with music by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley. Dahl was credited for writing the screenplay, but David Seltzer was brought in by Stuart and Wolper to make changes against Dahl's wishes, leaving his original adaptation, in one critic's opinion, \"scarcely detectable\".[49] Amongst other things, Dahl was unhappy with the foregrounding of Wonka over Charlie, and disliked the musical score. Because of this, Dahl disowned the film.[49] The film had an estimated budget of $2.9 million but grossed only $4 million and was considered a box-office disappointment, though it received positive reviews from critics. Home video and DVD sales, as well as repeated television airings, resulted in the film subsequently becoming a cult classic.[50] Concurrently with the 1971 film, the Quaker Oats Company introduced a line of candies whose marketing uses the book's characters and imagery.[51]Warner Bros. and the Dahl estate reached an agreement in 1998 to produce another film version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, with the Dahl family receiving total artistic control. The project languished in development hell until Tim Burton signed on to direct in 2003. The film, titled Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, starred Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. It was released in 2005 to positive reviews and massive box office returns, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film of the year.[52]In October 2016, Variety reported that Warner Bros. had acquired the rights to the Willy Wonka character from the Roald Dahl Estate and would be planning a new film centered on the eccentric character with David Heyman producing.[53] In February 2018, Paul King entered final negotiations to direct the film.[54] In May 2021, it was reported that the film would be a musical titled Wonka, with Timothée Chalamet playing a younger version of the titular character in an origin story.[55] King was confirmed as director and co-writer along with comedian Simon Farnaby; the film was released globally in December 2023.[56]Other adaptations\n[edit]Animated series\n[edit]On 27 November 2018, Netflix and The Roald Dahl Story Company jointly announced that Netflix would be producing an animated series based on Dahl's books, including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, The BFG, The Twits, and other titles. Production commenced on the first of the Netflix Dahl animated series in 2019.[70] On 5 March 2020, Variety announced that Taika Waititi was partnering with Netflix on a pair of animated series — one based on the world of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and another based on the Oompa-Loompa characters. “The shows will retain the quintessential spirit and tone of the original story while building out the world and characters far beyond the pages of the Dahl book for the very first time,” Netflix said.[71] On 23 February 2022, Mikros Animation revealed that they would be producing a new collaboration with Netflix. The collaboration was announced as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The long-format animated event series is based on the 1964 novel and is written, directed and executive produced by Waititi.[72][73]The book has been recorded a number of times:Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has undergone numerous editions and been illustrated by numerous artists.[80]Books\n[edit]50th anniversary cover controversy\n[edit]The cover photo of the 50th anniversary edition, published by Penguin Modern Classics for sale in the UK and aimed at the adult market, received widespread commentary and criticism.[82] The cover is a photo of a heavily made up young girl seated on her mother's knee and wearing a doll-like expression, taken by the photographers Sofia Sanchez and Mauro Mongiello as part of a photo shoot for a 2008 fashion article in a French magazine, for a fashion article titled \"Mommie Dearest.\"[81][83] In addition to writing that \"the image seemingly has little to do with the beloved children's classic\",[84] reviewers and commentators in social media (such as posters on the publisher's Facebook page) have said the art evokes Lolita, Valley of the Dolls, and JonBenet Ramsey; looks like a scene from Toddlers & Tiaras; and is \"misleading,\" \"creepy,\" \"sexualised,\" \"grotesque,\" \"misjudged on every level,\" \"distasteful and disrespectful to a gifted author and his work,\" \"pretentious,\" \"trashy\", \"outright inappropriate,\" \"terrifying,\" \"really obnoxious,\" and \"weird & kind of paedophilic.\"[81][85][86]The publisher explained its objective in a blog post accompanying the announcement about the jacket art: \"This new image . . . looks at the children at the center of the story, and highlights the way Roald Dahl’s writing manages to embrace both the light and the dark aspects of life.\"[87] Additionally, Penguin Press's Helen Conford told the Bookseller: \"We wanted something that spoke about the other qualities in the book. It's a children's story that also steps outside children's and people aren't used to seeing Dahl in that way.\" She continued: \"[There is] a lot of ill feeling about it, I think because it's such a treasured book and a book which isn't really a 'crossover book'\" As she acknowledged: \"People want it to remain as a children's book.\"The New Yorker describes what it calls this \"strangely but tellingly misbegotten\" cover design thusly: \"The image is a photograph, taken from a French fashion shoot, of a glassy-eyed, heavily made-up little girl. Behind her sits, a mother figure, stiff and coiffed, casting an ominous shadow. The girl, with her long, perfectly waved platinum-blond hair and her pink feather boa, looks like a pretty and inert doll—\" The article continues: \"And if the Stepford daughter on the cover is meant to remind us of Veruca Salt or Violet Beauregarde, she doesn't: those badly behaved squirts are bubbling over with rude life.\" Moreover, writes Talbot, \"The Modern Classics cover has not a whiff of this validation of childish imagination; instead, it seems to imply a deviant adult audience.\"[82]^ \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\".

{"title":"Where the Crawdads Sing","author":"Delia Owens","published":2018,"fiction":true,"plot":"Part I: The Marsh\n[edit]In 1952, six-year-old Kya watches her mother leave her abusive alcoholic husband. While Kya waits in vain for her mother's return, she sees her older siblings leave. Her father burns her mother's clothes and paintings.Alone with her father, Kya learns to fish. He gives her his knapsack for her collections of shells and feathers. Unable to read or write, Kya makes paintings of the objects, and the marsh's creatures and shorelines, with watercolors her mother left behind.One day Kya finds a letter from her mother in the mailbox and leaves it for her father to find. He burns the letter. He returns to drinking and takes long trips away to gamble. Eventually, he fails to return. She survives by gardening and trading fresh mussels and smoked fish for money and fuel from Jumpin', a black man who owns a gasoline station at the boat dock. She makes friends with Jumpin' and his wife Mabel, who collects donated clothing for her.The Barkley Cove townspeople nickname her \"The Marsh Girl\". On the only day she goes to school, the schoolchildren laugh at her; a pastor's wife calls her \"nasty\" and \"filthy\". However, she becomes friendly with Tate Walker, who fishes in the marsh. When Kya gets lost one day, Tate leads her home in his boat. Years later, he gives her feathers from rare birds, then teaches her to read and write. The two form a romantic relationship until Tate leaves for college. He promises to return, but leaves without saying goodbye.Part II: The Swamp\n[edit]Chase Andrews, Barkley Cove's star quarterback and playboy, invites Kya, aged 19, to a picnic, and tries to have sex with her. He later apologizes, and the two form a romantic relationship. He shows her an abandoned fire tower, and she gives him a necklace of a shell he found during their picnic, strung on a rawhide string. She believes Chase's promises of marriage, and they have sex in a cheap motel. The relationship ends when she sees in the newspaper that he is engaged.Tate, graduated from college, visits Kya and attempts to apologize for leaving her. She rejects him, but lets him inside her shack. He is impressed by her collection of seashells. He urges her to publish a reference book on them, which she does, with another on seabirds. With the money, she pays back taxes and fixes her home. Her brother Jodie, now in the Army, returns and breaks the news that their mother had been mentally ill and had died of leukemia two years earlier. He says he doesn't know where the other siblings are. He advises Kya to give Tate a second chance, then departs.Later, relaxing in a cove, Chase confronts Kya. An argument ensues; Chase attacks her and attempts to rape her. She fends him off and threatens to kill him if he doesn't leave her alone. The encounter is witnessed by two fishermen. Kya fears that reporting the assault would be futile as the town would blame her for \"being loose\". The next week, she sees Chase boating up to her shack; she hides until he leaves.Kya is invited to meet her publisher; she takes a bus to meet him. After she returns the next day, Chase is found dead beneath the fire tower, with no tracks or fingerprints nearby. The sheriff suspects murder. He gathers conflicting statements. He learns the shell necklace Kya gave to Chase was missing when his body was found, even though he wore it the night he died. Kya was seen leaving Barkley Cove before the murder, then returning the day after Chase died. There were red wool fibers on Chase's jacket from Kya's hat. Convinced she is the culprit, the sheriff arrests her for first-degree murder.At Kya's trial, only contradictory and circumstantial evidence is provided. Kya's lawyer debunks the prosecutor's arguments, as there is no evidence that Kya was at the fire tower on the night of Chase's death. The jury finds her not guilty. She returns home and reconciles with Tate. They live together in her shack until she dies peacefully in her boat at the age of 64. Later, searching for Kya's will, Tate finds a hidden box with some of her old possessions. He finds a poem that alludes to Chase's murder, and the shell necklace Chase wore. Tate burns the poems and the rawhide string before dropping the shell onto the beach. Kya is buried on her property near the shack.Crawdads\n[edit]The \"crawdads\" of the book's title is an American slang word for crayfish. These crustaceans cannot sing, but when Kya's mother encourages her to explore the marsh, she often says: \"Go as far as you can — way out yonder where the crawdads sing.\" When Tate also uses the phrase, Kya asks him the meaning and he replies: \"Just means far in the bush where critters are wild, still behaving like critters.\" Owens's mother had used the phrase when she was a child.[2] \"Crawdad\" is a regional term, and the book's success sparked a rise in online queries about the word's meaning.[3]Nature girl fantasy\n[edit]Adrian Horton, in The Guardian, describes the book as \"a fantasy of grit and purity\", offering \"a seductive blend of romance, murder mystery and feral coming-of-age\".[4] He comments that there are two timelines: a murder mystery, and the tale of Kya's growing up alone in the wild. In his view, the book's construction is not well conceived: in particular, the \"implausible twist ending ... undercuts almost everything that comes before, if you think about it for more than two seconds\". Further, he writes, the book treats the complications of relationships, physical hardship, and racism as \"wallpaper\", preferring to focus on its \"central nature girl fantasy of self-reliance\".[4]Mark Lawson, also in The Guardian, calls Kya \"a vivid and original character\", noting that Owens manages to show how Kya uses calculation and instinct to get herself \"into and out of difficulties\", mostly avoiding the trap of making her a superhero.[5] He comments that a coming-of-age romance could be sentimental, but that this tendency is countered by the crime fiction side of the novel.[5]Animal behavior\n[edit]The theme of ethology, Delia Owens' profession, the study of animal behavior, runs through the book. Kya reads about ethology, including an article titled \"Sneaky Fuckers\", where she learns about female fireflies, who use their coded flashing light signal to lure a male of another species to his death, and about female mantises who lure a male mate and start eating the mate's head and thorax while his abdomen is still copulating with her. Lawson comments that this \"spectacularly extend[s]\" the trope of having a wildlife documentary in the background while the characters engage in violence or sex. He adds that the biological \"anecdotes hover as metaphors for the behaviour of males in the story\".[5]Crime story\n[edit]Lawson likens Where the Crawdads Sing to Theodore Dreiser's 1925 novel An American Tragedy. In his view, its tale of \"social competition and violent death\" resembles a reworking of that melodramatic[5] tale, with its mix of tension and precise social detail.[5]Aspects of Kya's life and the novel's narrative choices, including its attitude towards its black characters, are said to be reminiscent of Owens's time in Zambia, where she, her then husband, and his son are still wanted for questioning in the killing of an alleged poacher captured on film in a 1996 report by ABC News. Owens is not a suspect, but is considered a possible witness, co-conspirator, or accessory.[7] The Los Angeles Times comments that the novel \"seems to draw from [Owens'] own involvement in the 1995 murder\", describing the story of her time in Zambia as a \"tumultuous history\".[8]Where the Crawdads Sing, Owens's debut novel,[9] was published by G. P. Putnam's Sons on August 14, 2018.[1] The book was selected for Reese Witherspoon's book club in September that year,[10] and for Barnes & Noble's Best Books of 2018.[11]By December 2019, the book had sold over 4.5 million copies, and it sold more print copies in 2019 than any other adult title, fiction or non-fiction.[12][13] It topped The New York Times Fiction Best Sellers of 2019 and The New York Times Fiction Best Sellers of 2020.[14][15] By February 2022, the book had spent 150 weeks on the best seller list.[16] By April 2022, the book had sold 12 million copies;[17] by July 2022, 15 million copies;[18] and by April 2023, 18 million copies,[19] making it one of the best-selling books of all time.[20][21][22][23]Main article: Where the Crawdads Sing (film)A film adaptation of the novel was released on July 15, 2022 in the US,[4] having been scheduled for July 22, 2022.[24] The film received mixed reviews from critics,[25] who praised Edgar-Jones's performance and the cinematography, but found the film's overall tone incoherent.[26][27] Audience reception was more positive, and the film became a box office success, grossing $144.3 million worldwide[28] on a $24 million budget.[29]^ a b Jordan, Tina (March 29, 2019). \"The Debut Novel That Rules the Best-Seller List\".

{"title":"Matilda","author":"Roald Dahl","published":1988,"fiction":true,"plot":"In a small Buckinghamshire village forty minutes by bus away from Reading and 8 miles from Aylesbury, Matilda Wormwood is born to Mr and Mrs Wormwood. She immediately shows amazing precocity, learning to speak at age one and to read at age three and a half, perusing all the children's books in the library by the age of four and three months and moving on to longer classics such as Great Expectations and Jane Eyre. Her parents however emotionally abuse her and completely refuse to acknowledge her abilities; to keep from getting frustrated, Matilda finds herself forced to pull pranks on them, such as gluing her father's hat to his head, sticking a parrot in the chimney to simulate a burglar or ghost, and bleaching her father's hair with peroxide.At the age of five and a half, Matilda enters school and befriends her polite and compassionate teacher Jennifer Honey, who is astonished by her intellectual abilities. Miss Honey tries to move Matilda into a higher class, but the tyrannical headmistress, Miss Agatha Trunchbull, refuses. Miss Honey also tries to talk to Mr and Mrs Wormwood about their daughter's intelligence, but they ignore her, with the mother contending \"brainy-ness\" is an undesirable trait in a little girl.Miss Trunchbull later confronts a girl called Amanda Thripp for wearing pigtails (the headmistress repeatedly displays a dislike of long hair throughout the book) and does a hammer throw with the girl over the playground fence. A boy called Bruce Bogtrotter is later caught by the cook stealing a piece of Miss Trunchbull's cake; the headmistress makes him attempt to eat an 18-inch (46 cm) wide cake in front of the assembly, then smashes the platter over his head in rage after he unexpectedly succeeds.Matilda quickly develops a particularly strong bond with Miss Honey and watches as Trunchbull terrorises her students with deliberately creative, over-the-top punishments to prevent parents from believing them, such as throwing them in a dark closet dubbed \"The Chokey\", which is lined with nails and broken glass. When Matilda's friend Lavender plays a practical joke on Trunchbull by placing a newt in her jug of water, Matilda is blamed; in anger, she uses an unexpected power of telekinesis to tip the glass of water containing the newt onto Trunchbull.Matilda reveals her new powers to Miss Honey, who confides that after her wealthy father, Dr Magnus Honey, suspiciously died, she was raised by an abusive aunt, revealed to be Miss Trunchbull. Trunchbull appears, among other misdeeds, to be withholding her niece's inheritance; Miss Honey has to live in poverty in a derelict farm cottage, and her salary is being paid into Miss Trunchbull's bank account for the first 10 years of her teaching career while she is restricted to £1 per week in pocket money. Preparing to avenge Miss Honey, Matilda practises her telekinesis at home. Later, during a sadistic lesson that Miss Trunchbull is teaching, Matilda telekinetically raises a piece of chalk to the blackboard and begins to use it to write, posing as the spirit of Magnus Honey. Addressing Miss Trunchbull using her first name (Agatha), \"Magnus\" demands that Miss Trunchbull hand over Miss Honey's house and wages and leave the school, causing Miss Trunchbull to faint.The next day, the school's deputy headmaster, Mr Trilby, visits Trunchbull's house and finds it empty, except for signs of Trunchbull's hasty exit. She is never seen again, and the next day Miss Honey receives a letter from a local solicitor's office, telling her that her father's lifetime savings were safe in her bank and the property she lived in as a child was left to her. Trilby becomes the new headmaster, proving himself to be capable and good-natured, overwhelmingly improving the school's atmosphere and curriculum, and quickly moving Matilda into the top-form class with the 11-year-olds. Rather to Matilda's relief, she soon is no longer capable of telekinesis. Miss Honey theorises this is because Matilda is using her brainpower on a more challenging curriculum, leaving less of her brain's enormous energy free.Matilda continues to visit Miss Honey at her house regularly, returning home one day to find her parents and her older brother Michael hastily packing to leave for Spain. Miss Honey explains this is because the police found out Mr Wormwood has been selling cars with tampered speedometers and sawdust. Matilda asks permission to live with Miss Honey, to which her parents rather distractedly agree. Matilda and Miss Honey find their happy ending, as the Wormwoods drive away, never to be seen again.Dahl's initial draft for the novel portrayed Matilda as a wicked, irrational girl—her name being drawn from Hilaire Belloc's poem \"Matilda\"—who tortured her innocent parents and used her psychokinetic powers to help an unethical teacher win money at horse racing. Dahl's biographer Jeremy Treglown went through the author's documents, including the drafts for the novel, and noted that the American editor Stephen Roxburgh at Farrar, Straus and Giroux had been instrumental in reshaping the story. It was Roxburgh's idea to make Matilda an innocent child who loved books, with her powers manifesting as a result of abuse she endured. Roxburgh also suggested various changes to the main characters that were incorporated into the finished novel. As Dahl decided to take the manuscript to a different publishers, the two had a falling out. The edited version of the manuscript was published by Puffin Books.[5] Dahl explained in an interview that he \"got it wrong\" at first and that the book took over a year to rewrite, though he failed to mention Roxburgh's input.[6][7]The year after the book was published, it received the 1989 Red House Children's Book Award. In 2000, it received the Blue Peter Book Award.[8] In 2003, Matilda was listed at number 74 in The Big Read, a BBC poll of the British public of the top 200 novels of all time.[1] In 2012 Matilda was ranked number 30 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published by School Library Journal, a monthly with primarily US audience. It was the first of four books by Dahl among the Top 100, more than any other writer.[2]Time magazine included Matilda in its list of the \"100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time\".[9] Worldwide sales have reached 17 million, and since 2016 sales have spiked to the extent that it outsells Dahl's other works.[10] In 2023, the novel was ranked by BBC at no. 10 in their poll of \"The 100 greatest children's books of all time\".[11]The \"mean and loathsome\" Mrs Pratchett, owner of the sweet shop Dahl frequented as a boy in Cardiff, inspired Dahl's creation of Miss Trunchbull.[12] Mr Wormwood was based on a real-life person from Dahl's home village of Great Missenden in Buckinghamshire.[13] The library in Great Missenden was the inspiration for Mrs Phelps's library, where Matilda devours classic literature by the age of four and three months.[14] On Matilda's love of reading books, Lucy Dahl stated that her father's novel was, in part, about his love for books: \"I think that there was a deep genuine fear within his heart that books were going to go away and he wanted to write about it\".[15]Further information: Matilda (1996 film), Matilda the Musical, and Matilda the Musical (film)In 1990, the Redgrave Theatre in Farnham produced a musical version, adapted by Rony Robinson with music by Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley, which toured the UK. It starred Annabelle Lanyon as Matilda and Jonathan Linsley as Miss Trunchbull and had mixed reviews.[16] A second musical version of the novel, Matilda the Musical, written by Dennis Kelly and Tim Minchin and commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare Company, premiered in November 2010. It opened at the Cambridge Theatre in the West End on 24 November 2011.[17][18] It opened on Broadway on 11 April 2013 at the Shubert Theatre. The musical has since done a US tour and opened in July 2015 in Australia. The stage version has become hugely popular with audiences and praised by critics, and won multiple Olivier Awards in the UK and Tony Awards in the US.[19] One critic called it \"the best British musical since Billy Elliot\".[20]The novel was made into the film Matilda in 1996. It starred Mara Wilson as Matilda, and was directed by Danny DeVito, who also portrayed Mr Wormwood and narrated the story. The film changed the setting and nationality of every character (except Trunchbull who is played by Welsh actress Pam Ferris) from British to American. Although not a commercial success, it received critical acclaim at the time of its release, and on Rotten Tomatoes has a score of 90% based on reviews from 21 critics.[21]In December 2009, BBC Radio 4's Classic Serial broadcast a two-part adaptation by Charlotte Jones of the novel with Lenny Henry as the Narrator, Lauren Mote as Matilda, Nichola McAuliffe as Miss Trunchbull, Emerald O'Hanrahan as Miss Honey, Claire Rushbrook as Mrs Wormwood and John Biggins as Mr Wormwood.[22]The book has been recorded as an audiobook by at least ten different narrators since the 1980s.[23] In 1998, Miriam Margolyes narrated an abridged recording for Penguin Random House (.mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}ISBN 0140868232 on cassette in 1998 and republished as ISBN 978-0141805542 on CD in 2004).[24] In 2004, Joely Richardson narrated the unabridged audiobook for Harper Childrens Audio (ISBN 978-0060582548).[25] In 2013, Kate Winslet narrated an unabridged recording for Listening Library (ISBN 978-1611761849);[26][27][28] in 2014, the American Library Association shortlisted her for an Odyssey Award for her performance.[29]In 2018, Netflix was revealed to be adapting Matilda as an animated series, as part of an \"animated event series\" along with other Roald Dahl books such as The BFG, The Twits, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.[30] A film adaptation of the musical was released by Sony Pictures Releasing and Netflix in 2022. It stars Alisha Weir as Matilda and Emma Thompson as Miss Trunchbull.[31][32] It is directed by Matthew Warchus.[33]The novel at 30\n[edit]Celebrating 30 years of the book's publication in October 2018, original illustrator Quentin Blake imagined what Matilda might be doing as a grown-up woman today. He drew images of her undertaking three possible roles: an explorer, an astrophysicist, and a librarian at the British Library.[10]2023 censorship controversy\n[edit]See also: Roald Dahl revision controversyDespite Roald Dahl having enjoined his publishers not to \"so much as change a single comma in one of my books\", in February 2023 Puffin Books, a division of Penguin Books, announced it would be re-writing portions of many of Dahl's children's novels, changing the language to, in the publisher's words, \"ensure that it can continue to be enjoyed by all today\".[34] The decision was met with sharp criticism from groups and public figures including authors Salman Rushdie,[35][36]Christopher Paolini,[35] British prime minister Rishi Sunak,[37]Queen Camilla,[37][38]Kemi Badenoch,[39]PEN America,[37] and Brian Cox.[39] Dahl's publishers in the United States, France, and the Netherlands declined to incorporate the changes.[37] Following the backlash, on 23 February, Puffin announced it would release an unedited selection of Dahl's children's books as \"The Roald Dahl Classic Collection\" because of \"the importance of keeping Dahl's classic texts in print\".[40][41]In Matilda, more than sixty changes were made, including replacing references to Rudyard Kipling and Joseph Conrad with Jane Austen and John Steinbeck, removing references to skin colour (such as \"turning white\", \"beginning to go dark red\", \"red in the face\", and \"white as paper\"), removing or changing the words fat, mad, and crazy (such as changing \"wobbling crazily\" to \"wobbling unsteadily\"), removing the word madonna, and changing heroine to hero.[42][43]One of Miss Trunchbull's punishments is to force an overweight child, Bruce Bogtrotter, to eat an enormous chocolate cake, which makes him so full that he cannot move. The cook had caught him stealing a piece of cake from the kitchen. In Roald Dahl's Revolting Recipes[44] one of the recipes is based on that cake. Bruce is a more sympathetic variation of Augustus Gloop (from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) and similar gluttons, and he is praised for finishing the cake without suffering nausea.[45] The short story The Magic Finger by Roald Dahl, released in 1966, may have been a precursor to Matilda. A young girl has power within her finger to do things to other people when she gets emotional about a cause she feels strongly about.In 2024 a collection of short stories by new writers titled Charlie and the Christmas Factory was published by Puffin including a continuation story on Matilda by Elle McNicoll.[46]^ a b \"The Big Read – Top 100 Books\".

{"title":"The Book Thief","author":"Markus Zusak","published":2005,"fiction":true,"plot":"The story begins in 1938 as Liesel Meminger, a nine-year-old girl, travels with her younger brother, Werner, on a train to their new foster home in Molching. Their mother, a Communist, can no longer care for them due to the rising dangers of the Nazi regime. Tragically, Werner dies during the journey, and Liesel, devastated, steals a book, The Gravedigger’s Handbook, from the train station. This act of theft marks the beginning of her connection to words and storytelling. She is unable to read but longs to learn.Upon arriving in Molching, Liesel is placed with her new foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann. Rosa is strict and harsh, often intimidating Liesel. Liesel finds comfort in her kindhearted foster father’s warmth and their bond, which grows through shared moments. Hans patiently helps Liesel as she struggles to learn to read, night after night when she awakens from nightmares.As Liesel settles into her new home, she struggles with feelings of abandonment and guilt over her brother's death. Her friendship with the neighbor boy, Rudy Steiner, provides her with companionship and adventure. Rudy idolizes Jesse Owens, the African American Olympic runner, and the two engage in mischievous activities, including pranks and stealing food.Liesel's love for books deepens, leading her to steal more books to satiate her hunger for stories. When she brings the washing from her foster mother's job to the mayor's mansion, the mayor's wife, Ilsa Hermann, shows Liesel an incredible library and allows her access to the books. But when the mayor and his wife fire Rosa, Liesel begins breaking into their house to steal books. Ilsa allows her to continue, leaving her gifts and a letter.The narrative takes a dramatic turn when the Hubermanns decide to hide a Jewish man named Max Vandenburg in their basement. Max's father had saved Hans's life when they fought together in World War I. As Max becomes part of their household, he and Liesel form a close bond through their love of words and storytelling. Max makes a storybook titled The Standover Man as a gift for Liesel, illustrating his struggles.As the war escalates, Liesel’s world is increasingly affected by the brutality of the Nazi regime. The Hubermanns risk their lives to protect Max. Liesel’s perspective on the world shifts as she becomes aware of the persecution of Jews and the impact of war on her community. Max has to leave the Hubermans' house after Hans shows a small act of kindness to a Jew who is being marched to a concentration camp, bringing Nazi suspicion down on the family. He is later captured by the Nazis, and Liesel sees him being marched to the same camp.The tension culminates during a bombing raid on Molching, with tragic consequences. Liesel survives the attack, but the Hubermanns’ home is destroyed, and she loses her beloved foster parents, Hans and Rosa. Among the victims of the bombing is Rudy Steiner, Liesel’s best friend and confidant, whose death leaves her devastated. This profound loss leaves Liesel alone and grappling with overwhelming grief.After the bombing, Liesel is taken in by the mayor and his wife, where she begins to piece her life back together. In her new environment, she finds comfort in reading and writing, continuing to honor the memory of Hans, Rosa, and Rudy. The mayor's wife, Ilsa, recognizes Liesel's talent and passion for storytelling. She is also able to meet Max again.As the war comes to a close, Liesel’s experiences shape her understanding of the world. The final chapters reveal Liesel as an adult, reflecting on her life and the memories of those she lost during the war. She eventually emigrates to Australia, where she marries and raises a family, but her heart remains tied to her childhood and the people who shaped her.In the conclusion, Death revisits Liesel's life, illustrating the impact of her story. He reflects on the enduring nature of human connections and the stories that shape our lives.Death\nDeath, the collector of souls, narrates the story of a young girl during the horrific times of Nazi Germany and the Second World War. To the reader, Death insists that things \"most definitely can be cheerful\" while relating that they most certainly also cannot be nice. Sometimes Death is \"compelled\" to take action in sympathy with the human story.Liesel Meminger\nThe story's protagonist is a girl on the verge of adolescence, with German blonde hair and brown eyes. The Hubermanns foster her after her biological father is taken away by the Nazis before the novel starts, due to being a Communist. Her brother dies and her mother is forced to send her to a foster home to avoid Nazi persecution. Liesel is the titular book thief; fascinated by the power of words, she steals several books throughout the story from a gravedigger, a bonfire, and the mayor's wife, Ilsa Hermann.Hans Hubermann (Papa)\nLiesel's foster father and husband to Rosa, Hans was a German soldier during the First World War. He is now an accordion player and painter. He develops a close and loving relationship with Liesel and becomes a source of strength and support for her. Like Liesel, he doesn't have much experience with reading. The two help each other with reading and write all the words they learn on a wall in the basement. He helps Max because Max's father saved Hans in the First World War.Rosa Hubermann (Mama)\nRosa is Liesel's sharp-tongued foster mother. She has a \"wardrobe\" build and a displeased face, five feet tall, brown-grey hair often tightly tied in a bun. Despite her temper, she is a loving wife to Hans and mother to Liesel. To supplement the household income, she does washing and ironing for wealthier households in Molching.Max Vandenburg\nA Jewish fist-fighter who takes refuge from the Nazi regime in the Hubermanns’ basement. He is the son of a First World War German soldier who fought alongside Hans Hubermann, and the two developed a close friendship during the war. He has brown, feather-like hair and swampy brown eyes. During the Nazi reign of terror, Hans agrees to shelter Max and hide him from the Nazi party. During his stay at the Hubermanns' house, Max befriends Liesel, and they share an affinity for words. He writes two books for her and presents her with a sketchbook that contains his life story, which helps Liesel to develop as a writer and reader, which, in turn, saves her life from the bombs falling on her.[1]Rudy Steiner\nLiesel's neighbor Rudy has bony legs, blue eyes, lemon-colored hair, and a penchant for getting in the middle of situations when he shouldn't. Despite having the appearance of an archetypal German, he does not support the Nazis. As a relatively poor household member with six children, Rudy is habitually hungry. He is known throughout the neighborhood because of the \"Jesse Owens incident\" in which he colored himself black with charcoal one night and ran one hundred meters at the local sports field. He is academically and athletically gifted which attracts the attention of Nazi Party officials, leading to attempted recruitment. His lack of support for the Nazi party becomes problematic as the story progresses. Rudy becomes Liesel's best friend and later falls in love with her.Ilsa Hermann\nThe wife of the mayor of Molching who employs Rosa Hubermann. She fell into a state of depression after the death of her only son Johann, in the Great War. Ilsa allows Liesel to visit, read, and steal books from her library. She gives Liesel a little black book which leads the girl to write her own story, \"The Book Thief\".[1]Werner Meminger (Liesel's brother)\nLiesel's little brother who died suddenly on the train with his mother and other sister, was buried in a cemetery near the train tracks. His death is what allowed the first book to be stolen: a gravedigger's manual dropped by a young boy learning to work in the cemetery.[1]Paula Meminger (Liesel's mother)\nLiesel's mother is only mentioned in the story a few times. She sent her children to foster care to save them from Nazi persecution. For a while, Liesel writes letters to her mother thinking there is a chance she is still alive.[1]Hans Jr (Hans' and Rosa's son)\nHans Jr is the son of Hans and Rosa Huberman. He is very supportive of the Nazi party and fights with his father about it frequently. He is eventually sent to participate in the Battle of Stalingrad.[1]Mortality\n[edit]The book is introduced by the character/narrator Death, which underlines that mortality is very present in the lives of each character. Throughout the novel, the deaths of prominent characters reaffirm the presence of mortality. Because the novel takes place during the Second World War, death and genocide are nearly omnipresent in the novel.Death is presented in a manner that is less distant and threatening. Because Death narrates and explains the reasons behind each character's destruction and explains how he feels that he must take the life of each character, Death is given a sense of care rather than fear. At one point, Death states \"even death has a heart,\" which reaffirms that there is a care present in the concept of death and dying.[2]Language, reading and writing\n[edit]Throughout the novel, language, reading, and writing are presented as symbolic elements of expression and freedom. They provide identity and personal liberation to those characters who have, or who gain, the power of literacy: \"the true power of words\", and they provide a framework for Liesel's coming of age. At the beginning of the story shortly after her brother's funeral, Liesel finds a book in the snow, one she is unable to read. Under tutelage by her foster father Hans, she slowly learns to read and write. By the end of the novel, her character arc is largely defined by her progress in reading and writing. The development of Liesel's literacy mirrors her physical growth and maturing over the course of the story.[3]Literacy skills and vernacular of speech also serve as social markers. Wealthy citizens in the story are often portrayed as literate, as owning books and even their own libraries, while the poor are illiterate and do not own books. Rosa Huberman's abrasive and oft-times scatological speech towards her family and others is emblematic of the despairing lives of the poorer classes.The Nazi burning of books in the story represents evil incarnate. Symbolically, Liesel's rescue of a book from a Nazi bonfire represents her reclaiming of freedom and her resistance to being controlled by the all-pervasive state.[2]Love\n[edit]In the midst of war and loss, love is a central theme which acts as a catalyst for change and sacrifice throughout the book. Liesel overcomes her traumas by learning to love and be loved by her foster family and her friends. At the beginning of the novel, Liesel is traumatized not only by the death of her brother and her separation from her only family but also by the larger issues of war-torn Germany and the destruction wrought by the Nazi party. As Liesel's foster father Hans develops a relationship with her, this relationship helps create healing and growth. This pattern is reflected in the dynamic between the Hubermann family and Max. In a society ruled by governmental policies that presume to stand in judgment of who is truly human, the Hubermanns' relationship with Max defies the Nazi regime. Furthermore, the love that Max and Liesel develop through their friendship creates a strong contrast to the fascist hate in the backdrop of the story, especially since Max is Jewish.The theme of love also intertwines with the themes of identity and language/reading because all of these themes have the purpose of providing freedom and power in the midst of chaos and control.[2] Liesel's final words in her own written story are \"I have hated the words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.\"[1] She has the power to show her love on paper.Main article: The Book Thief (film)A film adaptation was released on 8 November 2013.[7] It was directed by Brian Percival.

{"title":"The Horse Whisperer","author":"Nicholas Evans","published":1995,"fiction":true,"plot":"The novel starts in upstate New York where a teenage girl, Grace Maclean, and her friend, Judith, go riding on their horses, Pilgrim and Gulliver, on a snowy morning. As they ride up an icy slope, Gulliver slips and hits Pilgrim. Both horses fall, dragging the girls into a road and into a collision with a tractor-trailer. Judith and Gulliver are killed, while Grace and Pilgrim are severely injured. Grace, left with a partially amputated right leg, is bitter and withdrawn. Grace's mother, Annie, is a workaholic magazine editor, and her father, Robert, is a lawyer. The different approaches taken by each of Grace's parents in dealing with the accident strain relationships within the family.Following the accident, Pilgrim is traumatised and uncontrollable, leading his caretakers to mistreat him and to suggest that he be put down. Annie refuses to allow her horse to be put down and hears of a 'horse whisperer', Tom Booker. She undertakes a long cross country journey with Pilgrim and Grace to Montana.On the Montana ranch, Tom works with Pilgrim and starts to make progress. Both Grace and Annie become happier because the ranch life suits them. During the stay, Annie and Tom become close and eventually begin an affair.Despite the progress that Tom has made with Pilgrim, Grace is still unable to ride the horse. Tom attempts a drastic intervention by forcing the horse to lie down and having Grace stand on him. This technique works and horse and rider are reunited.At the party marking the end of Grace's and Annie's stay in Montana, Grace finds out about the affair, and she rides recklessly into the countryside. Grace unintentionally rides into a herd of wild mustangs that begin a stampede. Tom rides after her and finds Pilgrim fighting with the mustang stallion. Tom manages to save Grace and Pilgrim, but then deliberately gets himself fatally trampled by the stallion, perhaps because he feels guilty about hurting Grace by having an affair with her mother.Grace, Annie, and Pilgrim return to New York to rebuild their lives with Robert, but Annie discovers she is pregnant and eventually gives birth to a baby with Tom's blue eyes.According to writer Nicholas Evans,[3] Tom Booker is modelled after horse whisperers Tom Dorrance, Ray Hunt and, in particular, their younger disciple Buck Brannaman. Evans has said, \"Others have claimed to be the inspiration for Tom Booker in The Horse Whisperer. The one who truly inspired me was Buck Brannaman. His skill, understanding and his gentle, loving heart have parted the clouds for countless troubled creatures. Buck is the Zen master of the horse world.\"[4]Robert Redford bought the film rights for £3 million,[5] and the film The Horse Whisperer was released in 1998, with Redford himself in the title role as Tom Booker and Scarlett Johansson as Grace MacLean.The film is mostly faithful to the book but does not include Grace's confrontation with the herd of Mustangs, nor the death of Booker. Instead, Annie drives away from the ranch with Pilgrim in the trailer while Booker watches from the top of a hill. There is no indication in the movie that Annie and Tom sexually consummated their affair.^ The Forres Gazette Archived 27 September 2008 at the Wayback Machine on The Horse Whisperer: \"Mr Evans is the author of \"The Horse Whisperer\", which sold 15 million copies worldwide and was made into a Hollywood film in 1998 directed by and starring Robert Redford.\" (10 September 2008)\n^ \"BBC – The Big Read\".

{"title":"Don Quixote","author":"Miguel de Cervantes","published":1605,"fiction":true,"plot":"For Cervantes and the readers of his day, Don Quixote was a one-volume book published in 1605, divided internally into four parts, not the first part of a two-part set. The mention in the 1605 book of further adventures yet to be told was totally conventional, did not indicate any authorial plans for a continuation, and was not taken seriously by the book's first readers.[14]Part 1\n[edit]The first sally\n[edit]Cervantes, in a metafictional narrative, writes that the first few chapters were taken from \"the archives of La Mancha\", and the rest were translated from an Arabic text by the Moorish historian Cide Hamete Benengeli.Alonso Quixano is a hidalgo nearing 50 years of age who lives in a deliberately unspecified region of La Mancha with his niece and housekeeper. While he lives a frugal life, he is full of fantasies about chivalry stemming from his obsession with chivalric romance books. Eventually, his obsession becomes madness when he decides to become a knight errant, donning an old suit of armor. He renames himself \"Don Quixote\", names his old workhorse \"Rocinante\", and designates Aldonza Lorenzo (a slaughterhouse worker with a famed hand for salting pork) his lady love, renaming her Dulcinea del Toboso.As he travels in search of adventure, he arrives at an inn that he believes to be a castle, calls the prostitutes he meets there \"ladies\", and demands that the innkeeper, whom he takes to be the lord of the castle, dub him a knight. The innkeeper agrees. Quixote starts the night holding vigil at the inn's horse trough, which Quixote imagines to be a chapel. He then becomes involved in a fight with muleteers who try to remove his armor from the horse trough to water their mules. In a pretend ceremony, the innkeeper dubs him a knight to be rid of him and sends him on his way.Quixote next encounters a servant named Andres who is tied to a tree and being beaten by his master over disputed wages. Quixote orders the master to stop the beating, untie Andres and swear to treat his servant fairly. However, the beating is resumed, and redoubled, as soon as Quixote leaves.Quixote then chances upon traders from Toledo. He demands that they agree that Dulcinea del Toboso is the most beautiful woman in the world. One of them demands to see her picture so that he can decide for himself. Enraged, Quixote charges at them but his horse stumbles, causing him to fall. One of the traders beats up Quixote, who is left at the side of the road until a neighboring peasant brings him back home.While Quixote lies unconscious in his bed, his niece, the housekeeper, the parish curate, and the local barber burn most of his chivalric and other books, seeing them as the root of his madness. They seal up the library room, later telling Quixote that it was done by a wizard.The second sally\n[edit]Don Quixote asks his neighbour, the poor farm labourer Sancho Panza, to be his squire, promising him a petty governorship. Sancho agrees and they sneak away at dawn. Their adventures together begin with Quixote's attack on some windmills which he believes to be ferocious giants. They next encounter two Benedictine friars and, nearby, an unrelated lady in a carriage. Quixote takes the friars to be enchanters who are holding the lady captive, knocks one of them from his horse, and is challenged by an armed Basque travelling with the company. The combat ends with the lady leaving her carriage and begging him not to harm the Basque.After a friendly encounter with some goatherds and a less friendly one with some Yanguesan porters driving Galician ponies, Quixote and Sancho enter an inn owned by Juan Palomeque, where a mix-up involving a servant girl's romantic rendezvous with another guest results in a brawl. Quixote explains to Sancho that the inn is enchanted. They decide to leave, but Quixote, following the example of the fictional knights, leaves without paying. Sancho ends up wrapped in a blanket and tossed in the air by several mischievous guests at the inn before he manages to follow.After further adventures involving a dead body, a barber's basin that Quixote imagines as the legendary helmet of Mambrino, and a group of galley slaves, they wander into the Sierra Morena. There they encounter the dejected and mostly mad Cardenio, who relates his story. Inspired by Cardenio, Quixote decides to imitate what he has read in his chivalric romances and live like a hermit in a display of devotion to Dulcinea. He sends Sancho to deliver a letter to Dulcinea, but instead Sancho finds the barber and priest from his village. They make a plan to trick Quixote into coming home, recruiting Dorotea, a woman they discover in the forest, to pose as the Princess Micomicona, a damsel in distress.The plan works and Quixote and the group return to the inn, though Quixote is now convinced, thanks to a lie told by Sancho when asked about the letter, that Dulcinea wants to see him. At the inn, several other plots intersect and are resolved. Meanwhile, a sleepwalking Quixote does battle with some wineskins which he takes to be the giant who stole the princess Micomicona's kingdom. An officer of the Santa Hermandad arrives with a warrant for Quixote's arrest for freeing the galley slaves, but the priest begs for the officer to have mercy on account of Quixote's insanity. The officer agrees and Quixote is locked in a cage which he is made to think is an enchantment. He has a learned conversation with a Toledo canon he encounters by chance on the road, in which the canon expresses his scorn for untruthful chivalric books, but Don Quixote defends them. The group stops to eat and lets Quixote out of the cage; he gets into a fight with a goatherd and with a group of pilgrims, who beat him into submission, before he is finally brought home.The narrator ends the story by saying that he has found manuscripts of Quixote's further adventures.Part 2\n[edit]Although the two parts are now published as a single work, Don Quixote, Part Two was a sequel published ten years after the original novel. In an early example of metafiction, Part Two includes characters who have read the first part of the novel and are thus familiar with the history and peculiarities of the two protagonists.The third sally\n[edit]Don Quixote and Sancho are on their way to El Toboso to meet Dulcinea, with Sancho aware that his story about Dulcinea was a complete fabrication. They reach the city at daybreak and decide to enter at nightfall. However, a bad omen frightens Quixote into retreat and they quickly leave. Sancho is instead sent out alone by Quixote to meet Dulcinea and act as a go-between. Sancho's luck brings three peasant girls along the road and he quickly tells Quixote that they are Dulcinea and her ladies-in-waiting and as beautiful as ever. Since Quixote only sees the peasant girls, Sancho goes on to pretend that an enchantment of some sort is at work.A duke and duchess encounter the duo. These nobles have read Part One of the story and are themselves very fond of books of chivalry. They decide to play along for their own amusement, beginning a string of imagined adventures and practical jokes. As part of one prank, Quixote and Sancho are led to believe that the only way to release Dulcinea from her spell is for Sancho to give himself three thousand three hundred lashes. Sancho naturally resists this course of action, leading to friction with his master. Under the duke's patronage, Sancho eventually gets his promised governorship, though it is false, and he proves to be a wise and practical ruler before all ends in humiliation. Near the end, Don Quixote reluctantly sways towards sanity.Quixote battles the Knight of the White Moon (a young man from Quixote's hometown who had earlier posed as the Knight of Mirrors) on the beach in Barcelona. Defeated, Quixote submits to prearranged chivalric terms: the vanquished must obey the will of the conqueror. He is ordered to lay down his arms and cease his acts of chivalry for a period of one year, by which time his friends and relatives hope he will be cured.On the way back home, Quixote and Sancho \"resolve\" the disenchantment of Dulcinea. Upon returning to his village, Quixote announces his plan to retire to the countryside as a shepherd, but his housekeeper urges him to stay at home. Soon after, he retires to his bed with a deathly illness, and later awakes from a dream, having fully become Alonso Quixano once more. Sancho tries to restore his faith and his interest in Dulcinea, but Quixano only renounces his previous ambition and apologizes for the harm he has caused. He dictates his will, which includes a provision that his niece will be disinherited if she marries a man who reads books of chivalry.After Quixano dies, the author emphasizes that there are no more adventures to relate and that any further books about Don Quixote would be spurious.Other stories\n[edit]Don Quixote, Part One contains a number of stories which do not directly involve the two main characters, but which are narrated by some of the picaresque figures encountered by the Don and Sancho during their travels. The longest and best known of these is \"El Curioso Impertinente\" (The Ill-Advised Curiosity), found in Part One, Book Four. This story, read to a group of travelers at an inn, tells of a Florentine nobleman, Anselmo, who becomes obsessed with testing his wife's fidelity and talks his close friend Lothario into attempting to seduce her, with disastrous results for all.In Part Two, the author acknowledges the criticism of his digressions in Part One and promises to concentrate the narrative on the central characters (although at one point he laments that his narrative muse has been constrained in this manner). Nevertheless, \"Part Two\" contains several back narratives related by peripheral characters.Several abridged editions have been published which delete some or all of the extra tales in order to concentrate on the central narrative.[15]The Ill-Advised Curiosity summary\n[edit]The story within a story relates that, for no particular reason, Anselmo decides to test the fidelity of his wife, Camilla, and asks his friend, Lothario, to seduce her. Thinking that to be madness, Lothario reluctantly agrees, and soon reports to Anselmo that Camilla is a faithful wife. Anselmo learns that Lothario has lied and attempted no seduction. He makes Lothario promise to try in earnest and leaves town to make this easier. Lothario tries and Camilla writes letters to her husband telling him of the attempts by Lothario and asking him to return. Anselmo makes no reply and does not return. Lothario then falls in love with Camilla, who eventually reciprocates; an affair between them ensues, but is not disclosed to Anselmo, and their affair continues after Anselmo returns.One day, Lothario sees a man leaving Camilla's house and jealously presumes she has taken another lover. He tells Anselmo that, at last, he has been successful and arranges a time and place for Anselmo to see the seduction. Before this rendezvous, however, Lothario learns that the man was the lover of Camilla's maid. He and Camilla then contrive to deceive Anselmo further: When Anselmo watches them, she refuses Lothario, protests her love for her husband, and stabs herself lightly in the breast. Anselmo is reassured of her fidelity. The affair restarts with Anselmo none the wiser.Later, the maid's lover is discovered by Anselmo. Fearing that Anselmo will kill her, the maid says she will tell Anselmo a secret the next day. Anselmo tells Camilla that this is to happen, and Camilla expects that her affair is to be revealed. Lothario and Camilla flee that night. The maid flees the next day. Anselmo searches for them in vain before learning from a stranger of his wife's affair. He starts to write the story, but dies of grief before he can finish. Lothario is killed in battle soon afterward and Camilla dies of grief.Use of language\n[edit]The novel's farcical elements make use of punning and similar verbal playfulness. Character-naming in Don Quixote makes ample figural use of contradiction, inversion, and irony, such as the names Rocinante[16] (a reversal) and Dulcinea (an allusion to illusion), and the word quixote itself, possibly a pun on quijada (jaw) but certainly[17][18]cuixot (Catalan: thighs), a reference to a horse's rump.[19]As a military term, the word quijote refers to cuisses, part of a full suit of plate armour protecting the thighs. The Spanish suffix -ote denotes the augmentative—for example, grande means large, but grandote means extra large, with grotesque connotations. Following this example, Quixote would suggest 'The Great Quijano', an oxymoronic play on words that makes much sense in light of the character's delusions of grandeur.[20]Cervantes wrote his work in Early Modern Spanish, heavily borrowing from Old Spanish, the medieval form of the language. The language of Don Quixote, although still containing archaisms, is far more understandable to modern Spanish readers than is, for instance, the completely medieval Spanish of the Poema de mio Cid, a kind of Spanish that is as different from Cervantes' language as Middle English is from Modern English. The Old Castilian language was also used to show the higher class that came with being a knight errant.In Don Quixote, there are basically two different types of Castilian: Old Castilian is spoken only by Don Quixote, while the rest of the roles speak a contemporary (late 16th century) version of Spanish. The Old Castilian of Don Quixote is a humoristic resource—he copies the language spoken in the chivalric books that drove him to madness; and many times when he talks nobody is able to understand him because his language is too old. This humorous effect is more difficult to see nowadays because the reader must be able to distinguish the two old versions of the language, but when the book was published it was much celebrated. (English translations can get some sense of the effect by having Don Quixote use King James Bible or Shakespearean English, or even Middle English.)[21][22]In Old Castilian, the letter x represented the sound written sh in modern English, so the name was originally pronounced [kiˈʃote]. However, as Old Castilian evolved towards modern Spanish, a sound change caused it to be pronounced with a voiceless velar fricative [x] sound (like the Scots or German ch), and today the Spanish pronunciation of \"Quixote\" is [kiˈxote]. The original pronunciation is reflected in languages such as Asturian, Leonese, Galician, Catalan, Italian, Portuguese, Turkish and French, where it is pronounced with a \"sh\" or \"ch\" sound; the French opera Don Quichotte is one of the best-known modern examples of this pronunciation.Today, English speakers generally attempt something close to the modern Spanish pronunciation of Quixote (Quijote), as /kiːˈhoʊti/,[1] although the traditional English spelling-based pronunciation with the value of the letter x in modern English is still sometimes used, resulting in /ˈkwɪksət/ or /ˈkwɪksoʊt/. In Australian English, the preferred pronunciation amongst members of the educated classes was /ˈkwɪksət/ until well into the 1970s, as part of a tendency for the upper class to \"anglicise its borrowing ruthlessly\".[23] The traditional English rendering is preserved in the pronunciation of the adjectival form quixotic, i.e., /kwɪkˈsɒtɪk/,[24][25] defined by Merriam-Webster as the foolishly impractical pursuit of ideals, typically marked by rash and lofty romanticism.[26]Meaning\n[edit]Harold Bloom says Don Quixote is the first modern novel, and that the protagonist is at war with Freud's reality principle, which accepts the necessity of dying. Bloom says that the novel has an endless range of meanings, but that a recurring theme is the human need to withstand suffering.[27]Edith Grossman, who wrote and published a highly acclaimed[28] English translation of the novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, on the verge of both tragedy and comedy at the same time. Grossman has stated:Themes\n[edit]The novel's structure is episodic in form. The full title is indicative of the tale's object, as ingenioso (Spanish) means \"quick with inventiveness\",[30] marking the transition of modern literature from dramatic to thematic unity. The novel takes place over a long period of time, including many adventures united by common themes of the nature of reality, reading, and dialogue in general.Although burlesque on the surface, the novel, especially in its second half, has served as an important thematic source not only in literature but also in much of art and music, inspiring works by Pablo Picasso and Richard Strauss. The contrasts between the tall, thin, fancy-struck and idealistic Quixote and the fat diddy, world-weary Panza is a motif echoed ever since the book's publication, and Don Quixote's imaginings are the butt of outrageous and cruel practical jokes in the novel.Even faithful and simple Sancho is forced to deceive him at certain points. The novel is considered a satire of orthodoxy, veracity and even nationalism.[citation needed] In exploring the individualism of his characters, Cervantes helped lead literary practice beyond the narrow convention of the chivalric romance. He spoofs the chivalric romance[31] through a straightforward retelling of a series of acts that redound to the knightly virtues of the hero. The character of Don Quixote became so well known in its time that the word quixotic was quickly adopted by many languages. Characters such as Sancho Panza and Don Quixote's steed, Rocinante, are emblems of Western literary culture. The phrase \"tilting at windmills\" to describe an act of attacking imaginary enemies (or an act of extreme idealism), derives from an iconic scene in the book.It stands in a unique position between medieval romance and the modern novel. The former consists of disconnected stories featuring the same characters and settings with little exploration of the inner life of even the main character. The latter are usually focused on the psychological evolution of their characters. In Part I, Quixote imposes himself on his environment. By Part II, people know about him through \"having read his adventures\", and so, he needs to do less to maintain his image. By his deathbed, he has regained his sanity, and is once more \"Alonso Quixano the Good\".The cave of Medrano[32] (also known as the casa de Medrano) in Argamasilla de Alba, which has been known since the beginning of the 17th century, and according to the tradition of Argamasilla de Alba, was the prison of Miguel de Cervantes and the place where he conceived and began to write his famous work \"Don Quixote de la Mancha.\"[33][34][35][36][37][38][39]Sources\n[edit]Sources for Don Quixote include the Castilian novel Amadis de Gaula, which had enjoyed great popularity throughout the 16th century. Another prominent source, which Cervantes evidently admires more, is Tirant lo Blanch, which the priest describes in Chapter VI of Quixote as \"the best book in the world.\" (However, the sense in which it was \"best\" is much debated among scholars. Since the 19th century, the passage has been called \"the most difficult passage of Don Quixote\".) The scene of the book burning provides a list of Cervantes's likes and dislikes about literature.Cervantes makes a number of references to the Italian poem Orlando furioso. In chapter 10 of the first part of the novel, Don Quixote says he must take the magical helmet of Mambrino, an episode from Canto I of Orlando, and itself a reference to Matteo Maria Boiardo's Orlando innamorato.[40] The interpolated story in chapter 33 of Part four of the First Part is a retelling of a tale from Canto 43 of Orlando, regarding a man who tests the fidelity of his wife.[41]Another important source appears to have been Apuleius's The Golden Ass, one of the earliest known novels, a picaresque from late classical antiquity. The wineskins episode near the end of the interpolated tale \"The Curious Impertinent\" in chapter 35 of the first part of Don Quixote is a clear reference to Apuleius, and recent scholarship suggests that the moral philosophy and the basic trajectory of Apuleius's novel are fundamental to Cervantes' program.[42] Similarly, many of both Sancho's adventures in Part II and proverbs throughout are taken from popular Spanish and Italian folklore.Cervantes' experiences as a galley slave in Algiers also influenced Quixote.[43]Medical theories may have also influenced Cervantes' literary process. Cervantes had familial ties to the distinguished medical community. His father, Rodrigo de Cervantes, and his great-grandfather, Juan Díaz de Torreblanca, were surgeons. Additionally, his sister, Andrea de Cervantes, was a nurse.[44] He also befriended many individuals involved in the medical field, in that he knew medical author Francisco Díaz, an expert in urology, and royal doctor Antonio Ponce de Santa Cruz who served as a personal doctor to both Philip III and Philip IV of Spain.[45]Apart from the personal relations Cervantes maintained within the medical field, Cervantes' personal life was defined by an interest in medicine. He frequently visited patients from the Hospital de Inocentes in Sevilla.[44] Furthermore, Cervantes explored medicine in his personal library. His library contained more than 200 volumes and included books like Examen de Ingenios, by Juan Huarte and Practica y teórica de cirugía, by Dionisio Daza Chacón that defined medical literature and medical theories of his time.[45]Researchers Isabel Sanchez Duque and Francisco Javier Escudero have found that Cervantes was a friend of the family Villaseñor, which was involved in a combat with Francisco de Acuña. Both sides combated disguised as medieval knights in the road from El Toboso to Miguel Esteban in 1581. They also found a person called Rodrigo Quijada, who bought the title of nobility of \"hidalgo\", and created diverse conflicts with the help of a squire.[46][47]Spurious Second Part by Avellaneda\n[edit]It is not certain when Cervantes began writing Part Two of Don Quixote, but he had probably not proceeded much further than Chapter LIX by late July 1614. In about September, however, a spurious Part Two, entitled Second Volume of the Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha: by the Licenciado (doctorate) Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda, of Tordesillas, was published in Tarragona by an unidentified Aragonese who was an admirer of Lope de Vega, rival of Cervantes.[48] It was translated into English by William Augustus Yardley, Esquire in two volumes in 1784.Some modern scholars suggest that Don Quixote's fictional encounter with Avellaneda's book in Chapter 59 of Part II should not be taken as the date that Cervantes encountered it, which may have been much earlier.Avellaneda's identity has been the subject of many theories, but there is no consensus as to who he was. In its prologue, the author gratuitously insulted Cervantes, who took offense and responded; the last half of Chapter LIX and most of the following chapters of Cervantes's Segunda Parte lend some insight into the effects upon him; Cervantes manages to work in some subtle digs at Avellaneda's own work, and in his preface to Part II, comes very near to criticizing Avellaneda directly.In his introduction to The Portable Cervantes, Samuel Putnam, a noted translator of Cervantes' novel, calls Avellaneda's version \"one of the most disgraceful performances in history\".[49]The second part of Cervantes' Don Quixote, finished as a direct result of the Avellaneda book, has come to be regarded by some literary critics[50] as superior to the first part, because of its greater depth of characterization, its discussions, mostly between Quixote and Sancho, on diverse subjects, and its philosophical insights. In Cervantes's Segunda Parte, Don Quixote visits a printing-house in Barcelona and finds Avellaneda's Second Part being printed there, in an early example of metafiction.[51] Don Quixote and Sancho Panza also meet one of the characters from Avellaneda's book, Don Alvaro Tarfe, and make him swear that the \"other\" Quixote and Sancho are impostors.[52]Setting\n[edit]Location\n[edit]Cervantes' story takes place on the plains of La Mancha, specifically the comarca of Campo de Montiel.The location of the village to which Cervantes alludes in the opening sentence of Don Quixote has been the subject of debate since its publication over four centuries ago. Indeed, Cervantes deliberately omits the name of the village, giving an explanation in the final chapter:In 2004, a team of academics from Complutense University, led by Francisco Parra Luna, Manuel Fernández Nieto, and Santiago Petschen Verdaguer, deduced that the village was that of Villanueva de los Infantes.[53] Their findings were published in a paper titled \"'El Quijote' como un sistema de distancias/tiempos: hacia la localización del lugar de la Mancha\", which was later published as a book: El enigma resuelto del Quijote. The result was replicated in two subsequent investigations: \"La determinación del lugar de la Mancha como problema estadístico\" and \"The Kinematics of the Quixote and the Identity of the 'Place in La Mancha'\".[54][55]Translators of Don Quixote, such as John Ormsby,[56] have commented that the region of La Mancha is one of the most desertlike, unremarkable regions of Spain, the least romantic and fanciful place that one would imagine as the home of a courageous knight.On the other hand, as Borges points out:The story also takes place in El Toboso where Don Quixote goes to seek Dulcinea's blessings.Historical context\n[edit]Don Quixote is said to reflect the Spanish society in which Cervantes lived and wrote.[58]Spain's status as a world power was declining, and the Spanish national treasury was bankrupt due to expensive foreign wars.[58] Spanish cultural dominance was also waning as the Protestant Reformation had put the Spanish Roman Catholic Church on the defensive, which had led to the establishment of the Spanish Inquisition.[58] Meanwhile, the hidalgo class was losing relevance because of changes in Spanish society which made the high ideals of chivalry obsolete.[58]See also: List of works influenced by Don QuixoteInfluence on modern Spanish\n[edit]In 2002 the Norwegian Nobel Institute conducted a study among writers from 55 countries, the majority voted Don Quixote \"the greatest work of fiction ever written\".[59]The opening sentence of the book created a classic Spanish cliché with the phrase de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme (\"whose name I do not wish to recall\"):[60]En un lugar de la Mancha, de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme, no ha mucho tiempo que vivía un hidalgo de los de lanza en astillero, adarga antigua, rocín flaco y galgo corredor.[61] (\"In a village of La Mancha, whose name I do not wish to recall, there lived, not very long ago, one of those gentlemen with a lance in the lance-rack, an ancient shield, a skinny old horse, and a fast greyhound.\")[62]Influence on the English language\n[edit]Don Quixote alongside its many translations, has also provided a number of idioms and expressions to the English language. Examples with their own articles include the phrase \"the pot calling the kettle black\" and the adjective \"quixotic\".[63][64]Tilting at windmills\n[edit]\"Tilting at windmills\" redirects here. For other uses, see Tilting at windmills (disambiguation).Tilting at windmills is an English idiom that means \"attacking imaginary enemies\". The expression is derived from Don Quixote, and the word \"tilt\" in this context refers to jousting. This phrase is sometimes also expressed as \"charging at windmills\" or \"fighting the windmills\".[65]The phrase is sometimes used to describe either confrontations where adversaries are incorrectly perceived, or courses of action that are based on misinterpreted or misapplied heroic, romantic, or idealistic justifications.[66] It may also connote an inopportune, unfounded, and vain effort against adversaries real or imagined.[67]In science\n[edit]Dulcibella camanchaca, a deep-sea amphipod species, was named after the character Dulcinea in the novel, following the tradition of naming amphipods after literary figures.In July 1604, Cervantes sold the rights of El ingenioso hidalgo don Quixote de la Mancha (known as Don Quixote, Part I) to the publisher-bookseller Francisco de Robles for an unknown sum.[68] License to publish was granted in September, the printing was finished in December, and the book came out on 16 January 1605.[69][70]The novel was an immediate success. Most of the 400 copies of the first edition were sent to the New World, with the publisher hoping to get a better price in the Americas.[71] Although most of them disappeared in a shipwreck near La Havana, approximately 70 copies reached Lima, from where they were sent to Cuzco, in the heart of the defunct Inca Empire.[71]No sooner was it in the hands of the public than preparations were made to issue derivative (pirated) editions. In 1614 a fake second part was published by a mysterious author under the pen name Avellaneda. This author was never satisfactorily identified. This rushed Cervantes into writing and publishing a genuine second part in 1615, which was a year before his own death.[51]Don Quixote had been growing in favour, and its author's name was now known beyond the Pyrenees. By August 1605, there were two Madrid editions, two published in Lisbon, and one in Valencia. Publisher Francisco de Robles secured additional copyrights for Aragon and Portugal for a second edition.[72]Sale of these publishing rights deprived Cervantes of further financial profit on Part One. In 1607, an edition was printed in Brussels. Robles, the Madrid publisher, found it necessary to meet demand with a third edition, a seventh publication in all, in 1608. Popularity of the book in Italy was such that a Milan bookseller issued an Italian edition in 1610. Yet another Brussels edition was called for in 1611.[70] Since then, numerous editions have been released and in total, the novel is believed to have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide.[73] The work has been produced in numerous editions and languages, the Cervantes Collection, at the State Library of New South Wales includes over 1,100 editions. These were collected, by Ben Haneman, over a period of thirty years.[74]In 1613, Cervantes published the Novelas ejemplares, dedicated to the Maecenas of the day, the Conde de Lemos. Eight and a half years after Part One had appeared came the first hint of a forthcoming Segunda Parte (Part Two). \"You shall see shortly\", Cervantes says, \"the further exploits of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza.\"[75]Don Quixote, Part Two, published by the same press as its predecessor, appeared late in 1615, and quickly reprinted in Brussels and Valencia (1616) and Lisbon (1617). Parts One and Two were published as one edition in Barcelona in 1617. Historically, Cervantes' work has been said to have \"smiled Spain's chivalry away\", suggesting that Don Quixote as a chivalric satire contributed to the demise of Spanish Chivalry.[76]English editions in translation\n[edit]There are many translations of the book, and it has been adapted many times in shortened versions. Many derivative editions were also written at the time, as was the custom of envious or unscrupulous writers. Seven years after the Parte Primera appeared, Don Quixote had been translated into French, German, Italian, and English, with the first French translation of 'Part II' appearing in 1618, and the first English translation in 1620. One abridged adaptation, authored by Agustín Sánchez, runs slightly over 150 pages, cutting away about 750 pages.[77]Thomas Shelton's English translation of the First Part appeared in 1612 while Cervantes was still alive, although there is no evidence that Shelton had met the author. Although Shelton's version is cherished by some, according to John Ormsby and Samuel Putnam, it was far from satisfactory as a carrying over of Cervantes' text.[72] Shelton's translation of the novel's Second Part appeared in 1620.Near the end of the 17th century, John Phillips, a nephew of poet John Milton, published what Putnam considered the worst English translation. The translation, as literary critics claim, was not based on Cervantes' text but mostly on a French work by Filleau de Saint-Martin and on notes which Thomas Shelton had written.Around 1700, a version by Pierre Antoine Motteux appeared. Motteux's translation enjoyed lasting popularity; it was reprinted as the Modern Library Series edition of the novel until recent times.[78] Nonetheless, future translators would find much to fault in Motteux's version: Samuel Putnam criticized \"the prevailing slapstick quality of this work, especially where Sancho Panza is involved, the obtrusion of the obscene where it is found in the original, and the slurring of difficulties through omissions or expanding upon the text\". John Ormsby considered Motteux's version \"worse than worthless\", and denounced its \"infusion of Cockney flippancy and facetiousness\" into the original.[79]The proverb \"The proof of the pudding is in the eating\" is widely attributed to Cervantes. The Spanish word for pudding (budín), however, does not appear in the original text but premieres in the Motteux translation.[80] In Smollett's translation of 1755 he notes that the original text reads literally \"you will see when the eggs are fried\", meaning \"time will tell\".[81]A translation by Captain John Stevens, which revised Thomas Shelton's version, also appeared in 1700, but its publication was overshadowed by the simultaneous release of Motteux's translation.[78]In 1742, the Charles Jervas translation appeared, posthumously. Through a printer's error, it came to be known, and is still known, as \"the Jarvis translation\". It was the most scholarly and accurate English translation of the novel up to that time, but future translator John Ormsby points out in his own introduction to the novel that the Jarvis translation has been criticized as being too stiff. Nevertheless, it became the most frequently reprinted translation of the novel until about 1885. Another 18th-century translation into English was that of Tobias Smollett, himself a novelist, first published in 1755. Like the Jarvis translation, it continues to be reprinted today.A translation by Alexander James Duffield appeared in 1881 and another by Henry Edward Watts in 1888. Most modern translators take as their model the 1885 translation by John Ormsby.[82]An expurgated children's version, under the title The Story of Don Quixote, was published in 1922 (available on Project Gutenberg). It leaves out the risqué sections as well as chapters that young readers might consider dull, and embellishes a great deal on Cervantes' original text. The title page actually gives credit to the two editors as if they were the authors, and omits any mention of Cervantes.[83]The most widely read English-language translations of the mid-20th century are by Samuel Putnam (1949), J. M. Cohen (1950; Penguin Classics), and Walter Starkie (1957). The last English translation of the novel in the 20th century was by Burton Raffel, published in 1996. The 21st century has already seen five new translations of the novel into English. The first is by John D. Rutherford and the second by Edith Grossman. Reviewing the novel in The New York Times, Carlos Fuentes called Grossman's translation a \"major literary achievement\"[84] and another called it the \"most transparent and least impeded among more than a dozen English translations going back to the 17th century.\"[85]In 2005, the year of the novel's 400th anniversary, Tom Lathrop published a new English translation of the novel, based on a lifetime of specialized study of the novel and its history.[86] The fourth translation of the 21st century was released in 2006 by former university librarian James H. Montgomery, 26 years after he had begun it, in an attempt to \"recreate the sense of the original as closely as possible, though not at the expense of Cervantes' literary style.\"[87]In 2011, another translation by Gerald J. Davis appeared, which is self-published via Lulu.com.[88] The latest and the sixth translation of the 21st century is Diana de Armas Wilson's 2020 revision of Burton Raffel's translation.Thomas Shelton (1612 & 1620)\nJohn Phillips (1687) – the nephew of John Milton\nCaptain John Stevens (1700) (revision of Thomas Shelton)\nNed Ward (1700), (The) Life & Notable Adventures of Don Quixote merrily translated into Hudibrastic Verse\nPierre Antoine Motteux (1700)\nJohn Ozell (1719) (revision of Pierre Antoine Motteux)\nCharles Jervas (1742)\nDr. Tobias Smollett (1755) (revision of Charles Jervas)\nGeorge Kelly (1769) (considered as another revision of Pierre Antoine Motteux)\nCharles Henry Wilmot (1774)\nMary Smirke with engravings by Robert Smirke (1818)\nPierre Antoine Motteux, edited by John Gibson Lockhart (1822)\nAlexander James Duffield (1881)\nJohn Ormsby (1885).

In Part 2, hidalgo is replaced with caballero (pronounced [kaβaˈʎeɾo]), meaning \"knight\".\n^ Milan Kundera, John le Carré, John Irving,[4]Doris Lessing, Salman Rushdie, Miriam Lebwohl, Nadine Gordimer, Wole Soyinka, Seamus Heaney, Carlos Fuentes, Norman Mailer, and Astrid Lindgren[5] were among the authors polled.\n^ Although in popular usage, the term identifies a nobleman or woman, hidalga, without a hereditary title, the reality of the hidalguía, that is, the condition of hidalgo or hidalga, was, in practice, much more complex. Among other aspects, although not usually great landowners, hidalgos were exempted from paying taxes.\n^ \"A curious exemplification of the power of a single book for good or harm is shown in the effects wrought by Don Quixote and those wrought by Ivanhoe. The first swept the world's admiration for the mediaeval chivalry-silliness out of existence; and the other restored it. As far as our South is concerned, the good work done by Cervantes is pretty nearly a dead letter, so effectually has Scott's pernicious influence undermined it.\" Mark Twain (1883).

{"title":"The Little Prince","author":"Antoine de Saint-Exupéry","published":1943,"fiction":true,"plot":"The book begins with the six-year-old narrator. To determine if grownups are as enlightened as a child, the narrator shows them a picture depicting a boa constrictor that has eaten an elephant. The adults always reply that the picture represents a hat. Upon making a second drawing depicting the elephant inside the boa constrictor, the adults tell him to study things of \"importance.\" He learns to only talk of \"reasonable\" things to them, rather than the fanciful.The narrator becomes an aircraft pilot, and one day, his plane crashes in the Sahara desert, far from civilization. The narrator must fix his airplane before his supply of water runs out. Here, he is greeted by a young boy named \"the little prince.\"The prince asks the narrator to draw a sheep. The narrator first shows him the picture of the elephant inside the snake, which, to the narrator's surprise, the prince interprets correctly. After three failed attempts at drawing a sheep, the frustrated narrator draws a crate, claiming the sheep is inside. Surprisingly, this drawing delights the little prince.Over the course of days, while the narrator attempts to repair his plane, the prince recounts his life story. He used to live on a house-sized asteroid known on Earth as \"B 612\". The narrator recounts a story of a Turkish astronomer who, after discovering asteroid B 612, gave a presentation on his findings, but was ignored. After dressing in European garments, however, his discoveries were accepted. The asteroid has three minuscule volcanoes (two active, and one dormant or extinct) and various plants.The prince used to clean the volcanoes and weed unwanted seeds and sprigs that infested his soil, pulling out baobab trees that were constantly on the verge of overrunning the surface. The prince wants a sheep to eat the undesirable plants, but worries it will also eat plants with thorns.The prince met a rose that grew on the asteroid. The rose exaggerated ailments to have the prince care for her. The prince made a screen and glass globe to protect her from the cold and wind, watered her, and kept the caterpillars off.Despite falling in love with the rose, the prince also began to feel that she was taking advantage of him and resolved to leave the planet to explore the rest of the universe. Upon saying their goodbyes, the rose apologized for failing to show that she loved him. She wished him well and turned down his desire to leave her in the glass globe, saying she would protect herself. The prince laments that he does not understand how to love his rose while being with her.The prince has since visited six other planets, each of which was inhabited by one adult. They include:Since the prince landed in a desert, he believed that Earth was uninhabited. He then met a snake that claimed to have the power to return him to his home, if he ever wished that. The prince next met a flower, who said she had only seen a few men in that part of the world, and they had no roots, letting the wind blow them around and living hard lives. After climbing the highest mountain he had ever seen, the prince hoped to see the whole of Earth, thus finding the people; however, he saw only the desolate landscape. When the prince called out, his echo answered him, which he interpreted as the voice of someone boring who only repeats words.The prince encountered a row of rosebushes, becoming downcast at having once thought that his rose was unique and thinking she had lied about being unique. He began to feel that he was not a great prince, as his planet contained only three tiny volcanoes and a flower he now thought of as common. He started weeping until a fox/civet came along.The fox desired to be tamed and taught the prince how to tame him. By being tamed, something goes from being ordinary or commonplace to being special and unique...but \"what we tame, we are responsible for forever.\"From the fox/civet, the prince learns that his rose was indeed special because she was the object of the prince's love and time; he had \"tamed\" her, and now she was more precious than all of the other roses. Upon their departure, the fox says that important things can only be seen with the heart, not the eyes.The prince then met two people from Earth:Eight days after the plane crash, the narrator and the prince are dying of thirst. The prince becomes morose and longs to return home and see his flower.The prince finds a well, saving them. The narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his desire to see his rose again, worrying that she has been left to fend for herself. The prince bids farewell to the narrator and states that if it looks as though he has died, it is only because his body is too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince's side. The prince says that the narrator only needs to look at the stars to think of the prince's laughter and that it will seem as if all the stars are laughing. The prince then walks away and allows the snake to bite him, falling down.The next morning, the narrator cannot find the prince's body. Managing to repair his airplane, he leaves the desert. The narrator requests to be contacted by anyone in that area who encounters a boy like the prince.The story of The Little Prince is recalled in a sombre, measured tone by the pilot-narrator, in memory of his small friend, \"a memorial to the prince—not just to the prince, but also to the time the prince and the narrator had together.\"[19]The Little Prince was created when Saint-Exupéry was \"an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"[14] According to one analysis, \"the story of the Little Prince features a lot of fantastical, unrealistic elements.... You can't ride a flock of birds to another planet... The fantasy of the Little Prince works because the logic of the story is based on the imagination of children, rather than the strict realism of adults.\"[20]An exquisite literary perfectionist, akin to the 19th century French poet Stéphane Mallarmé,[21] Saint-Exupéry produced draft pages \"covered with fine lines of handwriting, much of it painstakingly crossed out, with one word left standing where there were a hundred words, one sentence substitut[ing] for a page...\"[22] He worked \"long hours with great concentration.\" According to the author himself, it was extremely difficult to start his creative writing processes.[23] Biographer Paul Webster wrote of the aviator-author's style: \"Behind Saint-Exupéry's quest for perfection was a laborious process of editing and rewriting which reduced original drafts by as much as two-thirds.\"[24] The French author frequently wrote at night, usually starting at about 11 p.m. accompanied by a tray of strong black coffee. In 1942 Saint-Exupéry related to his American English teacher, Adèle Breaux, that at such a time of night he felt \"free\" and able to concentrate, \"writing for hours without feeling tired or sleepy\", until he instantaneously dozed off.[22] He would wake up later, in daylight, still at his desk, with his head on his arms. Saint-Exupéry stated it was the only way he could work, as once he started a writing project it became an obsession.[25]A native speaker of French, Saint-Exupéry was never able to achieve anything more than haltingly poor English. Adèle Breaux, his young Northport English tutor to whom he later dedicated a writing (\"For Miss Adèle Breaux, who so gently guided me in the mysteries of the English language\"), related her experiences with her famous student as Saint-Exupéry in America, 1942–1943: A Memoir, published in 1971.[26]\"Saint-Exupéry's prodigious writings and studies of literature sometimes gripped him, and on occasion he continued his readings of literary works until moments before take-off on solitary military reconnaissance flights, as he was adept at both reading and writing while flying. Taking off with an open book balanced on his leg, his ground crew would fear his mission would quickly end after contacting something 'very hard'. On one flight, to the chagrin of colleagues awaiting his arrival, he circled the Tunis airport for an hour so that he could finish reading a novel. Saint-Exupéry frequently flew with a lined carnet (notebook) during his long, solo flights, and some of his philosophical writings were created during such periods when he could reflect on the world below him, becoming 'enmeshed in a search for ideals which he translated into fable and parable'.\"[27][28]Events and characters\n[edit]In The Little Prince, its narrator, the pilot, talks of being stranded in the desert beside his crashed aircraft. The account clearly drew on Saint-Exupéry's own experience in the Sahara, an ordeal described in detail in his 1939 memoir Wind, Sand and Stars (original French: Terre des hommes).[9]On 30 December 1935, at 2.45am, after 19 hours and 44 minutes in the air, Saint-Exupéry, along with his copilot-navigator André Prévot, crashed in the Sahara desert.[29] They were attempting to break the speed record for a Paris-to-Saigon flight in a then-popular type of air race called a raid, that had a prize of 150,000 francs.[30] Their plane was a Caudron C-630 Simoun,[Note 3] and the crash site is thought to have been near to the Wadi Natrun valley, close to the Nile Delta.[31]Both miraculously survived the crash, only to face rapid dehydration in the intense desert heat.[32] Their maps were primitive and ambiguous. Lost among the sand dunes with a few grapes, a thermos of coffee, a single orange, and some wine, the pair had only one day's worth of liquid. They both began to see vivid hallucinations. By the second and third days, they were so dehydrated that they stopped sweating altogether. Finally, on the fourth day, a Bedouin on a camel discovered them and administered a native rehydration treatment, which saved Saint-Exupéry's and Prévot's lives.[30]In the novella, the fox, believed to be modelled after the author's intimate New York City friend, Silvia Hamilton Reinhardt, tells the prince that his rose is unique and special, as she is the one he loves.[33] The novella's iconic phrase, \"One sees clearly only with the heart\" is believed to have been suggested by Reinhardt.The fearsome, grasping baobab trees, researchers have contended, were meant to represent Nazism attempting to destroy the planet.[33] The little prince's reassurance to the pilot that the prince's body is only an empty shell resembles the last words of Antoine's dying younger brother François, who told the author, from his deathbed: \"Don't worry. I'm all right. I can't help it. It's my body\".[34]Rose\n[edit]Many researchers believe that the prince's kindhearted, but petulant and vain, Rose was inspired by Saint-Exupéry's Salvadoran wife Consuelo de Saint-Exupéry,[33][35] with the small home planet being inspired by El Salvador where he crashed and stayed to recover while being within view of 3 volcanoes, one of which was Ilamatepec, also known as The Santa Ana Volcano.[36] Despite a tumultuous marriage, Saint-Exupéry kept Consuelo close to his heart and portrayed her as the prince's rose, whom he tenderly protects with a wind screen and places under a glass dome on his tiny planet. Saint-Exupéry's infidelity and the doubts of his marriage are symbolized by the vast field of roses the prince encounters during his visit to Earth.[9]This interpretation was described by biographer Paul Webster who stated she was \"the muse to whom Saint-Exupéry poured out his soul in copious letters ... Consuelo was the rose in The Little Prince. \"I should have judged her by her acts and not by her words\", says the prince. \"She wrapped herself around me and enlightened me. I should never have fled. I should have guessed at the tenderness behind her poor ruses.\"[24]Prince\n[edit]Saint-Exupéry probably has drawn inspiration for the prince's character and appearance from his own self as a youth, as during his early years friends and family called him le Roi-Soleil (\"the Sun King\") because of his golden curly hair.[citation needed] The author had also met a precocious eight-year-old with curly blond hair while he was residing with a family in Quebec City in 1942, Thomas De Koninck, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck.[37][38][39] Another possible inspiration for the little prince has been suggested as Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of fellow aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, whom he met during an overnight stay at their Long Island home in 1939.[40][41][Note 4]Some have seen the prince as a Christ figure, as the child is sin-free and \"believes in a life after death\", subsequently returning to his personal heaven.[42] When Life photojournalist John Phillips questioned the author-aviator on his inspiration for the child character, Saint-Exupéry told him that one day he looked down on what he thought was a blank sheet and saw a small childlike figure: \"I asked him who he was\", he replied. \"I'm the Little Prince\" was the reply.[43]One of Saint-Exupéry's earliest literary references to a small prince is to be found in his second news dispatch from Moscow, dated 14 May 1935. In his writings as a special correspondent for Paris-Soir, the author described traveling from France to the Soviet Union by train. Late at night, during the trip, he ventured from his first-class accommodation into the third-class carriages, where he came upon large groups of Polish families huddled together, returning to their homeland. His commentary not only described a diminutive prince but also touched on several other themes Saint-Exupéry incorporated into various philosophical writings:[44]Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, a laureate of several of France's highest literary awards and a successful pioneering aviator prior to the war, Saint-Exupéry initially flew with a reconnaissance squadron as a reserve military pilot in the Armée de l'Air (French Air Force).[9] After France's defeat in 1940 and its armistice with Germany, he and Consuelo fled Occupied France and sojourned in North America, with Saint-Exupéry first arriving by himself at the very end of December 1940. His intention for the visit was to convince the United States to quickly enter the war against Nazi Germany and the Axis forces, and he soon became one of the expatriate voices of the French Resistance. In the midst of personal upheavals and failing health, he produced almost half of the writings for which he would be remembered, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love and loss, in the form of a young prince visiting Earth.[45]An earlier memoir by the author recounted his aviation experiences in the Sahara, and he is thought to have drawn on the same experiences as plot elements in The Little Prince.He wrote and illustrated the manuscript during the summer and fall of 1942. Although greeted warmly by French-speaking Americans and by fellow expatriates who had preceded him in New York, his 27-month stay would be marred by health problems and racked with periods of severe stress and marital strife. These included partisan attacks on the author's neutral stance towards supporters of both ardent French Gaullist and Vichy France.[46] Saint-Exupéry's American translator (the author spoke poor English) wrote: \"He was restless and unhappy in exile, seeing no way to fight again for his country and refusing to take part in the political quarrels that set Frenchman against Frenchman.\"[22] However, the period was to be both a \"dark but productive time\" during which he created three important works.[47]Between January 1941 and April 1943, the Saint-Exupérys lived in two penthouse apartments on Central Park South,[48] then, at the Delamater-Bevin Mansion in Asharoken, Long Island, and still later, a rented brownstone on Beekman Place, again in New York City.[49][50]The couple also stayed in Quebec for five weeks during the late spring of 1942, where they met a precocious eight-year-old boy with blond curly hair, Thomas, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck, with whom the Saint-Exupérys resided.[51][52][53][54] During an earlier visit to Long Island in August 1939, Saint-Exupéry had also met Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of the pioneering American aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh.[40][41]After returning to the US from his Quebec speaking tour, Saint-Exupéry was pressed to work on a children's book by Elizabeth Reynal, one of the wives of his US publisher, Reynal & Hitchcock. The French wife of Eugene Reynal had closely observed Saint-Exupéry for several months, and noting his ill health and high stress levels, she suggested to him that working on a children's story would help.[55][Note 5] The author wrote and illustrated The Little Prince at various locations in New York City but principally in the Long Island north-shore community of Asharoken in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October.[50][51][51]Although the book was started in his Central Park South penthouse, Saint-Exupéry soon found New York City's noise and sweltering summer heat too uncomfortable to work in and so Consuelo was dispatched to find improved accommodations. After spending some time at an unsuitable clapboard country house in Westport, Connecticut,[56] they found Bevin House, a 22-room mansion in Asharoken that overlooked Long Island Sound. The author-aviator initially complained, \"I wanted a hut, and it's the Palace of Versailles.\"[45] As the weeks wore on, the author became invested in his project and the home would become \"a haven for writing, the best place I have ever had anywhere in my life.\"[57] He devoted himself to the book on mostly midnight shifts,[22] usually starting at about 11 pm, fueled by helpings of scrambled eggs on English muffins, gin and tonics, Coca-Colas, cigarettes and numerous visits by friends and expatriates who dropped in to see their famous countryman. One of the visitors was his wife's Swiss writer paramour Denis de Rougemont, who also modeled for a painting of the Little Prince lying on his stomach, feet and arms extended up in the air.[45][50] De Rougemont would later help Consuelo write her autobiography, The Tale of the Rose, as well as write his own biography of Saint-Exupéry.While the author's personal life was frequently chaotic, his creative process while writing was disciplined. Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan Library and Museum which had obtained Saint-Exupéry's original manuscript in 1968, stated: \"On the one hand, he had a clear vision for the shape, tone, and message of the story. On the other hand, he was ruthless about chopping out entire passages that just weren't quite right\", eventually distilling the 30,000 word manuscript, accompanied by small illustrations and sketches, to approximately half its original length.[58] The story, the curator added, was created when he was \"an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"[14]The large white Second French Empire-style mansion, hidden behind tall trees, afforded the writer a multitude of work environments, but he usually wrote at a large dining table.[22] It also allowed him to alternately work on his writings and then on his sketches and watercolours for hours at a time, moving his armchair and paint easel from the library towards the parlor one room at a time in search of sunlight. His meditative view of sunsets at the Bevin House were incorporated in the book, where the prince visits a small planet with 43 daily sunsets, a planet where all that is needed to watch a sunset \"is move your chair a few steps.\"[45][50][Note 6]Manuscript\n[edit]The original 140-page autograph manuscript of The Little Prince, along with various drafts and trial drawings, were acquired from the author's close friend Silvia Hamilton in 1968 by curator Herbert Cahoon of the Pierpont Morgan Library (now The Morgan Library & Museum) in Manhattan, New York City.[11][59][60] It is the only known surviving handwritten draft of the complete work.[61] The manuscript's pages include large amounts of the author's prose that was struck-through and therefore not published as part of the first edition. In addition to the manuscript, several watercolour illustrations by the author are also held by the museum. They were not part of the first edition. The institution has marked both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of the novella's publication, along with the centenary celebration of the author's birth, with major exhibitions of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's literary works.[33][62] Physically, the manuscript's onion skin media has become brittle and subject to damage. Saint-Exupéry's handwriting is described as being doctor-like, verging on indecipherable.[63]The story's keynote aphorism, On ne voit bien qu'avec le cœur. L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux (\"One sees clearly only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye\") was reworded and rewritten some 15 times before achieving its final phrasing. Saint-Exupéry also used a Dictaphone recorder to produce oral drafts for his typist.[22][59] His initial 30,000-word working manuscript was distilled to less than half its original size through laborious editing sessions. Multiple versions of its many pages were created and its prose then polished over several drafts, with the author occasionally telephoning friends at 2:00 a.m. to solicit opinions on his newly written passages.[22]Many pages and illustrations were cut from the finished work as he sought to maintain a sense of ambiguity to the story's theme and messages. Included among the deletions in its 17th chapter were references to locales in New York, such as the Rockefeller Center and Long Island. Other deleted pages described the prince's vegetarian diet and the garden on his home asteroid that included beans, radishes, potatoes and tomatoes, but which lacked fruit trees that might have overwhelmed the prince's planetoid. Deleted chapters discussed visits to other asteroids occupied by a retailer brimming with marketing phrases, and an inventor whose creation could produce any object desired at a touch of its controls. Likely the result of the ongoing war in Europe weighing on Saint-Exupéry's shoulders, the author produced a sombre three-page epilogue lamenting \"On one star someone has lost a friend, on another someone is ill, on another someone is at war...\", with the story's pilot-narrator noting of The Prince: \"he sees all that. . . . For him, the night is hopeless. And for me, his friend, the night is also hopeless.\" The draft epilogue was also omitted from the novella's printing.[59]Further information: Morgan exhibitionsIn April 2012 a Parisian auction house announced the discovery of two previously unknown draft manuscript pages that included new text.[10][64] In the newly discovered material the Prince meets his first Earthling after his arrival. The person he meets is an \"ambassador of the human spirit\".[10][64] The ambassador is too busy to talk, saying he is searching for a missing six letter word: \"I am looking for a six-letter word that starts with G that means 'gargling' \", he says. Saint-Exupéry's text does not say what the word is, but experts believe it could be \"guerre\" (or \"war\"). The novella thus takes a more politicized tack with an anti-war sentiment, as 'to gargle' in French is an informal reference to 'honour', which the author may have viewed as a key factor in military confrontations between nations.[64][65]Dedication\n[edit]Saint-Exupéry met Léon Werth (1878–1955), a writer and art critic, in 1931. Werth soon became Saint-Exupery's closest friend outside of his Aeropostale associates. Werth was an anarchist, a leftist Bolshevik supporter of Jewish descent, twenty-two years older than Saint-Exupéry.Saint-Exupéry dedicated two books to him, Lettre à un otage [fr] (Letter to a Hostage) and Le Petit Prince (The Little Prince), and referred to Werth in three more of his works. At the beginning of the Second World War while writing The Little Prince, Saint-Exupéry lived in his downtown New York City apartment, thinking of his native France and his friends. Werth spent the war unobtrusively in Saint-Amour, his village in the Jura, a mountainous region near Switzerland where he was \"alone, cold and hungry\", a place that had few polite words for French refugees. Werth appears in the preamble to the novella, where Saint-Exupéry dedicates the book to him:[66]Saint-Exupéry's aircraft disappeared over the Mediterranean in July 1944. The following month, Werth learned of his friend's disappearance from a radio broadcast. Without having yet heard of The Little Prince, in November, Werth discovered that Saint-Exupéry had published a fable the previous year in the U.S., which he had illustrated himself, and that it was dedicated to him.[67] At the end of the Second World War, which Antoine de Saint-Exupéry did not live to see, Werth said: \"Peace, without Tonio (Saint-Exupéry) isn't entirely peace.\" Werth did not see the text for which he was so responsible until five months after his friend's death, when Saint-Exupéry's French publisher, Gallimard, sent him a special edition. Werth died in Paris in 1955.Illustrations\n[edit]All of the novella's simple but elegant watercolour illustrations, which were integral to the story, were painted by Saint-Exupéry. He had studied architecture as a young adult but nevertheless could not be considered an artist – which he self-mockingly alluded to in the novella's introduction. Several of his illustrations were painted on the wrong side of the delicate onion skin paper that he used as his medium of choice.[50] As with some of his draft manuscripts, he occasionally gave away preliminary sketches to close friends and colleagues; others were even recovered as crumpled balls from the floors in the cockpits he flew.[Note 7] Two or three original Little Prince drawings were reported in the collections of New York artist, sculptor and experimental filmmaker Joseph Cornell.[68] One rare original Little Prince watercolour would be mysteriously sold at a second-hand book fair in Japan in 1994, and subsequently authenticated in 2007.[69][70]An unrepentant lifelong doodler and sketcher, Saint-Exupéry had for many years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined notebooks and other scraps of paper.[43][45] Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged in a variety of tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in Robert Crumb's Keep On Truckin' of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend, he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher's office.[43] Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as \"...a slip of a boy with a turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had a puzzled expression... [T]his boy Saint-Exupéry came to think of as \"the little prince\", and he was usually found standing on top of a tiny planet. Most of the time he was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet.\"[56] His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exupéry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a \"realistic ideal\".[45] Saint-Exupéry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source. One \"most striking\" illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exupéry's editing process.[14]To mark both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of The Little Prince's publication, the Morgan Library and Museum mounted major exhibitions of Saint-Exupéry's draft manuscript, preparatory drawings, and similar materials that it had obtained earlier from a variety of sources. One major source was an intimate friend of his in New York City, Silvia Hamilton (later, Reinhardt), to whom the author gave his working manuscript just prior to returning to Algiers to resume his work as a Free French Air Force pilot.[33][62][71] Hamilton's black poodle, Mocha, is believed to have been the model for the Little Prince's sheep, with a Raggedy Ann type doll helping as a stand-in for the prince.[61] Additionally, a pet boxer, Hannibal, that Hamilton gave to him as a gift may have been the model for the story's desert fox and its tiger.[47] A museum representative stated that the novella's final drawings were lost.[33]Seven unpublished drawings for the book were also displayed at the museum's exhibit, including fearsome looking baobab trees ready to destroy the prince's home asteroid, as well as a picture of the story's narrator, the forlorn pilot, sleeping next to his aircraft. That image was likely omitted to avoid giving the story a 'literalness' that would distract its readers, according to one of the Morgan Library's staff.[33] According to Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan, \"[t]he image evokes Saint-Exupéry's own experience of awakening in an isolated, mysterious place. You can almost imagine him wandering without much food and water and conjuring up the character of the Little Prince.\"[14] Another reviewer noted that the author \"chose the best illustrations... to maintain the ethereal tone he wanted his story to exude. Choosing between ambiguity and literal text and illustrations, Saint-Exupéry chose in every case to obfuscate.\"[72] Not a single drawing of the story's narrator–pilot survived the author's editing process; \"he was very good at excising what was not essential to his story\".[14]In 2001 Japanese researcher Yoshitsugu Kunugiyama surmised that the cover illustration Saint-Exupéry painted for Le Petit Prince deliberately depicted a stellar arrangement created to celebrate the author's own centennial of birth. According to Kunugiyama, the cover art chosen from one of Saint-Exupéry's watercolour illustrations contained the planets Saturn and Jupiter, plus the star Aldebaran, arranged as an isosceles triangle, a celestial configuration which occurred in the early 1940s, and which he likely knew would next reoccur in the year 2000.[73] Saint-Exupéry possessed superior mathematical skills and was a master celestial navigator, a vocation he had studied at Salon-de-Provence with the Armée de l'Air (French Air Force).Post-publication\n[edit]Stacy Schiff, one of Saint-Exupéry's principal biographers, wrote of him and his most famous work, \"rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound together as Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and his Little Prince\", and remarking of their dual fates, \"the two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky\".[74] Another noted that the novella's mystique was \"enhanced by the parallel between author and subject: imperious innocents whose lives consist of equal parts flight and failed love, who fall to earth, are little impressed with what they find here and ultimately disappear without a trace.\"[75]Only weeks after his novella was first published in April 1943, despite his wife's pleadings and before Saint-Exupéry had received any of its royalties (he never would), the author-aviator joined the Free French Forces. He would remain immensely proud of The Little Prince, and almost always kept a personal copy with him which he often read to others during the war.[74]Further information: Antoine de Saint-Exupéry – DisappearanceAs part of a 32-ship military convoy he voyaged to North Africa where he rejoined his old squadron to fight with the Allies, resuming his work as a reconnaissance pilot despite the best efforts of his friends, colleagues and fellow airmen who could not prevent him from flying.[Note 8] He had previously escaped death by the barest of margins a number of times, but was then lost in action during a July 1944 spy mission from the moonscapes of Corsica to the continent in preparation for the Allied invasion of occupied France, only three weeks before the Liberation of Paris.[45][Note 9]Reception\n[edit]Many of the book's initial reviewers were flummoxed by the fable's multi-layered story line and its morals,[9] perhaps expecting a significantly more conventional story from one of France's leading writers. Its publisher had anticipated such reactions to a work that fell neither exclusively into a children's nor adults' literature classification. The New York Times reviewer wrote shortly before its publication \"What makes a good children's book? ... The Little Prince, which is a fascinating fable for grown-ups [is] of conjectural value for boys and girls of 6, 8 and 10. [It] may very well be a book on the order of Gulliver's Travels, something that exists on two levels\"; \"Can you clutter up a narrative with paradox and irony and still hold the interest of 8 and 10-year olds?\" Notwithstanding the story's duality, the review added that major portions of the story would probably still \"capture the imagination of any child.\"[78] Addressing whether it was written for children or adults, Reynal & Hitchcock promoted it ambiguously, saying that as far as they were concerned \"it's the new book by Saint-Exupéry\", adding to its dustcover \"There are few stories which in some way, in some degree, change the world forever for their readers. This is one.\"[59]Others were not shy in offering their praise. Austin Stevens, also of The New York Times, stated that the story possessed \"...large portions of the Saint-Exupéry philosophy and poetic spirit. In a way it's a sort of credo.\"[56] P. L. Travers, author of the Mary Poppins series of children books, wrote in a New York Herald Tribune review: \"The Little Prince will shine upon children with a sidewise gleam. It will strike them in some place that is not the mind and glow there until the time comes for them to comprehend it.\"[59][79]British journalist Neil Clark, in The American Conservative in 2009, offered an expansive view of Saint-Exupéry's overall work by commenting that it provides a \"…bird's eye view of humanity [and] contains some of the most profound observations on the human condition ever written\", and that the author's novella \"doesn't merely express his contempt for selfishness and materialism [but] shows how life should be lived.\"[80]The book enjoyed modest initial success, residing on The New York Times Best Seller list for only two weeks,[63] as opposed to his earlier 1939 English translation, Wind, Sand and Stars which remained on the same list for nearly five months.[43] As a cultural icon, the novella regularly draws new readers and reviewers, selling almost two million copies annually and also spawning numerous adaptations. Modern-day references to The Little Prince include one from The New York Times that describes it as \"abstract\" and \"fabulistic\".[62]See also: The Little Prince § TranslationsIn April 2017, The Little Prince became the world's most translated non-religious book, with translations into 300 languages.[81] This number had risen to 600 by November 2024.[82]Katherine Woods (1886–1968)[83] produced the first English translation of 1943, which was later joined by several other English translations. Her translation contained some errors.[84][85] Mistranslations aside, one reviewer noted that Woods's almost \"poetic\" English translation has long been admired by many Little Prince lovers, who have spanned generations (it stayed in print until 2001), as her work maintains Saint-Exupéry's story-telling spirit and charm, if not its literal accuracy.[72] As of 2019[update] at least seven additional English translations have been published:[86]The Little Prince was also translated by Bonnie Greer for a BBC radio adaptation in 1999.Each translation approaches the essence of the original with an individual style and focus.[89][90]Le Petit Prince is often used as a beginner's book for French-language students, and several bilingual and trilingual translations have been published. As of 2017, it has been translated into more than 300 languages and dialects, including Sardinian,[91] the constructed languages of Esperanto and Klingon, and the Congolese language Alur, as well as being printed in Braille for blind readers. It is also often used as an introduction into endangered varieties with very few speakers like Maya (2001), Aromanian (2006), or Banat Bulgarian (2017). It is one of the few modern books to have been translated into Latin, as Regulus, vel Pueri soli sapiunt[92][93] in 1961 by Auguste Haury (1910–2002) and as Regulus in 2010 by Alexander Winkler. A translation of the book was published as U'cc priinsâž in Skolt Sámi translated by Skolt Sámi author Kati-Claudia Fofonoff in 2000, a language spoken in Sápmi. At the time, the language was spoken by less than 500 people making it the smallest language with a translation of Le Petit Prince. In 2005, the book was also translated into Toba Qom, an indigenous language of northern Argentina, as So Shiyaxauolec Nta'a. It was the first book translated into that language since the New Testament. It was also translated to a northern Italian dialect, Vogherese. Anthropologist Florence Tola, commenting on the suitability of the work for Toban translation, said there is \"nothing strange [when] the Little Prince speaks with a snake or a fox and travels among the stars, it fits perfectly into the Toba mythology\".[94]Linguists have compared the many translations and even editions of the same translation for style, composition, titles, wordings and genealogy. As an example: as of 2011 there are approximately 47 translated editions of The Little Prince in Korean,[Note 10] and there are also about 50 different translated editions in Chinese (produced in both mainland China and Taiwan). Many of them are titled Prince From a Star, while others carry the book title that is a direct translation of The Little Prince.[96] By studying the use of word phrasings, nouns, mistranslations and other content in newer editions, linguists can identify the source material for each version: whether it was derived from the original French typescript, or from its first translation into English by Katherine Woods, or from a number of adapted sources.[72][97]The first edition to be published in France, Saint-Exupéry's birthplace, was printed by his regular publisher in that country, Gallimard, only after[8] the German occupation of France ended.[98][Note 11] Prior to France's liberation new printings of Saint-Exupéry's works were made available only by means of secret print runs,[100][101] such as that of February 1943 when 1,000 copies of an underground version of his best seller Pilote de guerre, describing the German invasion of France, were covertly printed in Lyon.[102]Commemorating the novella's 70th anniversary of publication, in conjunction with the 2014 Morgan Exhibition, Éditions Gallimard released a complete facsimile edition of Saint-Exupéry's original handwritten manuscript entitled Le Manuscrit du Petit Prince d'Antoine de Saint-Exupéry: Facsimilé et Transcription, edited by Alban Cerisier and Delphine Lacroix. The book in its final form has also been republished in 70th anniversary editions by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (in English) and by Gallimard (in French).[61]A Portuguese translation of the novella in 2007, edited by Eidouro Gráfica e Editora Ltda and presented at the XIII Biannual Book Fair of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, holds the Guinness World Record for world's largest book published.[103] The impressive tome measures 2.01 m (6 ft 7 in) high and 3.08 m (10 ft 1 in) wide when open, containing 128 pages.It has been translated into minority languages, such as the Irish language, by Éabhloid publishers in 2015.Spanish editions\n[edit]After being translated by Bonifacio del Carril, The Little Prince was first published in Spanish as El principito in September 1951 by the Argentine publisher Emecé Editores.[104][105] Other Spanish editions have also been created; in 1956 the Mexican publisher Diana released its first edition of the book, El pequeño príncipe, a Spanish translation by José María Francés.[8] Another edition of the work was produced in Spain in 1964 and, four years later, in 1968, editions were also produced in Colombia and Cuba, with translation by Luis Fernández in 1961. Chile had its first translation in 1981; Peru in February 1985; Venezuela in 1986, and Uruguay in 1990.[104][106][107] The book is among the few books in the Castilian cant Gacería[108] (as El pitoche engrullón) or the Madrid slang Cheli[109] (as El chaval principeras).Bavarian editions\n[edit]The Little Prince has an adaptation for the inhabitants of Bavaria, Austria and South Tyrol, covering for a large variety of the Bavarian language. The book was adapted by Johannes Limmer and published in 2019. It is called Da gloane Prinz and contains the original pictures of Saint-Exupéry.[110]Chinese editions\n[edit]The Little Prince is one of the most popular and beloved foreign works of literature in China. It is reported that there are more than 70 Chinese translations of the novella.[111] According to the official website of the Succession Antoine de Saint-Exupéry-d'Agay, the version translated by Li Jihong, which was published in January 2013, sold over two million copies in less than four years.[112]Cheng Li-chun published a translation in Taiwan in May 2022.[113]Extension of copyrights in France\n[edit]Due to Saint-Exupéry's wartime death, his estate received the civil code designation Mort pour la France (English: Died for France), which was applied by the French government in 1948. Amongst the law's provisions is an increase of 30 years in the duration of copyright;[114] thus most of Saint-Exupéry's creative works will not fall out of copyright status in France for an extra 30 years.[115][75]The book will remain under copyright in the US until 2039[116][117] and will remain in copyright in France until 2033 or 2045.[118][119]Main article: List of The Little Prince adaptationsThe wide appeal of Saint-Exupéry's novella has led to it being adapted into numerous forms over the decades. Additionally, the title character himself has been adapted in a number of promotional roles, including as a symbol of environmental protection, by the Toshiba Group.[120] He has also been portrayed as a \"virtual ambassador\" in a campaign against smoking, employed by the Veolia Energy Services Group,[120] and his name was used as an episode title in the TV series Lost.The multi-layered fable, styled as a children's story with its philosophical elements of irony and paradox directed towards adults, allowed The Little Prince to be transferred into various other art forms and media, including:In 1997, Jean-Pierre Davidts wrote what could be considered a sequel to The Little Prince, entitled Le petit prince retrouvé (The Little Prince Returns).[126] In this version, the shipwrecked narrator encounters the little prince on a lone island; the prince has returned to seek help against a tiger who threatens his sheep.[127] Another sequel titled The Return of the Little Prince was written by former actress Ysatis de Saint-Simone, niece of Consuelo de Saint-Exupéry.[128]Museums and exhibits\n[edit]Morgan exhibitions\n[edit]New York City's Morgan Library & Museum mounted three showings of the original manuscript, with its first showing in 1994, on the occasion of the story's 50th anniversary of publication, followed by one celebrating the author's centennial of birth in 2000, with its last and largest exhibition in 2014 honouring the novella's 70th anniversary.The 1994 exhibition displayed the original manuscript, translated by the museum's art historian Ruth Kraemer,[129] as well as a number of the story's watercolours drawn from the Morgan's permanent collection. Also included with the exhibits was a 20-minute video it produced, My Grown-Up Friend, Saint-Exupéry, narrated by actor Macaulay Culkin,[Note 12] along with photos of the author, correspondence to Consuelo, a signed first edition of The Little Prince, and several international editions in other languages.[93]In January 2014, the museum mounted a third, significantly larger, exhibition centered on the novella's creative origins and its history. The major showing of The Little Prince: A New York Story celebrated the story's 70th anniversary.[62] It examined both the novella's New York origins and Saint-Exupéry's creative processes, looking at his story and paintings as they evolved from conceptual germ form into progressively more refined versions and finally into the book's highly polished first edition. It was as if visitors were able to look over his shoulder as he worked, according to curator Christine Nelson. Funding for the 2014 exhibition was provided by several benefactors, including The Florence Gould Foundation, The Caroline Macomber Fund, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Air France and the New York State Council on the Arts.[61]The new, more comprehensive exhibits included 35 watercolor paintings and 25 of the work's original 140 handwritten manuscript pages,[131] with his almost illegible handwriting penciled onto 'Fidelity' watermarked onion skin paper. The autograph manuscript pages included struck-through content that was not published in the novella's first edition. As well, some 43 preparatory pencil drawings that evolved into the story's illustrations accompanied the manuscript, many of them dampened by moisture that rippled its onion skin media.[132][133] One painting depicted the prince floating above Earth wearing a yellow scarf was wrinkled, having been crumpled up and thrown away before being retrieved for preservation.[47] Another drawing loaned from Silvia Hamilton's grandson depicted the diminutive prince observing a sunset on his home asteroid; two other versions of the same drawing were also displayed alongside it allowing visitors to observe the drawing's progressive refinement.[59] The initial working manuscript and sketches, displayed side by side with pages from the novella's first edition, allowed viewers to observe the evolution of Saint-Exupéry's work.Shortly before departing the United States to rejoin his reconnaissance squadron in North Africa in its struggle against Nazi Germany, Saint-Exupéry appeared unexpectedly in military uniform at the door of his intimate friend, Silvia Hamilton. He presented his working manuscript and its preliminary drawings in a \"rumpled paper bag\", placed onto her home's entryway table, offering, \"I'd like to give you something splendid, but this is all I have\".[62][71][79][133][134] Several of the manuscript pages bore accidental coffee stains and cigarette scorch marks.[47] The Morgan later acquired the 30,000-word manuscript from Hamilton in 1968, with its pages becoming the centrepieces of its exhibitions on Saint-Exupéry's work. The 2014 exhibition also borrowed artifacts and the author's personal letters from the Saint-Exupéry-d'Gay Estate,[Note 13] as well as materials from other private collections, libraries and museums in the United States and France.[135] Running concurrent with its 2014 exhibition, the Morgan held a series of lectures, concerts and film showings, including talks by Saint-Exupéry biographer Stacy Schiff, writer Adam Gopnik, and author Peter Sís on his new work The Pilot and The Little Prince: The Life of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry,[134][136]Additional exhibits included photos of Saint-Exupéry by Life photojournalist John Phillips, other photos of the author's New York area homes,[61] an Orson Welles screenplay of the novella the filmmaker attempted to produce as a movie in collaboration with Walt Disney,[43][62][Note 14] as well as one of the few signed copies extant of The Little Prince, gifted to Hamilton's 12-year-old son.[Note 15]Permanent exhibits\n[edit]Special exhibitions\n[edit]Places\n[edit]Playground\n[edit]Schools\n[edit]Avenue\n[edit]Insignia and awards\n[edit]Numismatics and philatelic\n[edit]Astronomy\n[edit]Professional wrestling\n[edit]French professional wrestler Daniel Dubail was billed as Le Petit Prince.[165][166] Pakistani-British professional wrestler Mohammed Allam was billed as The Little Prince.[167][166]The Little Prince Day\n[edit]Since 2020, June 29 is International Little Prince Day. This date was chosen to commemorate the birth of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, which occurred on June 29, 1900. The Antoine de Saint-Exupéry Foundation started the initiative striving to promote the humanist values carried by the book published in 1943. Mark Osborne was one of the first personalities to participate in the Little Prince Day 2020.[168]Merchandise and collaboration\n[edit]In 2023, The Little Prince inspired a collaboration with Chinese toy brand Pop Mart and artist Hideaki Kawashima’s Hirono series. Titled \"Pop Mart x Le Petit Prince – La Nouvelle Série de Figurines par Hirono\", the collection features reinterpretations of characters from the novella, including the Little Prince, the Rose, and the Fox. The figurines depict scenes such as the Little Prince standing atop his asteroid B612 and interacting with the Fox under a starry sky. The collaboration was marketed as a celebration of the story’s themes of love, friendship, and exploration.[169]The Montblanc Luxury Writing Instrument Company created three series of luxury fountain pens based on the Little Prince series,[170] including the Le Petit Prince, the Le Petit Prince Aviator and the Le Petit Prince and Planet pens [171] in various models.^ Note that although Saint-Exupéry's regular French publisher, Gallimard, lists Le Petit Prince as being published in 1946, that is apparently a legalistic interpretation possibly designed to allow for an extra year of the novella's copyright protection period, and is based on Gallimard's explanation that the book was only 'sold' starting in 1946. Other sources, such as LePetitPrince.com,[8] record the first Librairie Gallimard printing of 12,250 copies as occurring on 30 November 1945.\n^ The Antoine de Saint-Exupéry Foundation estimates an additional 80 million copies of the story in audio-video formats have been sold worldwide.[13]\n^ The plane Saint-Exupéry was flying when he crashed at high speed in the Sahara was a Caudron C-630 Simoun, Serial Number 7042, with the French registration F-ANRY ('F' being the international designator for France, and the remainder chosen by the author to represent ANtoine de saint-exupéRY).\n^ Fox[edit] In some versions of the Little Prince, the Fox would be considered a Civet, according to my school-provided book and teacher, whom I shall not name for their privacy. The school-provided book on where it can be found is: According to Hoffman, \"Anne Morrow Lindbergh's fascination with Saint-Ex was transparent in all she wrote about him, as might be expected when one aviator-writer romantic is writing about another.\" Saint-Exupéry visited with Anne for two days but spoke with Charles Lindbergh, who arrived home late, for an hour. Besides their vast differences on how Adolf Hitler and the European conflict should be treated, Charles did not speak French, and Saint-Exupéry did not speak English well. Their discussions, passed through Anne's meager French, were somewhat muted. However, the excited conversation between Antoine and Anne soon blossomed \"like monster flowers\", with each finishing the other's sentences. Ironically, while Saint-Exupéry would later campaign for an early US entry into the war, Lindbergh strongly opposed American involvement in the European war and wanted an arrangement with Hitler, like Stalin's. The meeting between the two future P-38 war pilots was termed \"less than a rousing success\". Moreover, Charles later became unhappy about his wife's vast esteem for the French adventurer.\"\n^ Another source states that it was co-publisher Curtice Hitchcock who viewed the author sketches and doodles at a supper party one evening and then suggested writing a children's book to Saint-Exupéry.[56] An additional likely reason for the publisher's encouragement: P. L. Travers, the author of the popular children's books series on Mary Poppins, was at that time working on her third installment that would be published by a Reynal & Hitchcock competitor in 1943, the same year as The Little Prince. Saint-Exupéry's U.S. publisher pressed him to have a competing children's book on the market for Christmas 1942.\n^ Saint-Exupéry was 43 the year the fable was published, and 44 the year he died. He originally wrote the story with 43 sunsets, but posthumous editions often quote '44 sunsets', possibly in tribute.\n^ On one of Saint-Exupéry's flights his aircraft engine started failing. His aircraft mechanic onboard later recalled that Saint-Exupéry was completely calm, \"Saint-Ex simply started doodling cartoons which he handed back to me with a big grin.\"[24]\n^ Following one of his crashes in a sophisticated single-pilot spy aircraft that resulted in him being grounded, Saint-Exupéry spared no effort in his campaign to return to active combat flying duty. He utilized all his contacts and powers of persuasion to overcome his age and physical handicap barriers, which would have completely barred an ordinary patriot from serving as a war pilot. Instrumental in his reinstatement was an agreement he proposed to John Phillips, a fluently bilingual Life Magazine correspondent in February 1944, where Saint-Exupéry committed to \"write, and I'll donate what I do to you, for your publication, if you get me reinstated into my squadron.\"[76] Phillips later met with a high-level U.S. Army Air Forces press officer in Italy, Colonel John Reagan McCrary, who conveyed the Life Magazine request to General Eaker. Eaker's approval for Saint-Exupéry's return to flying status would be made \"not through favoritism, but through exception.\" The brutalized French, it was noted, would cut a German's throat \"probably with more relish than anybody.\"\n^ Various sources state that his final flight was either his seventh, eight, ninth, or even his tenth covert reconnaissance mission. He volunteered for almost every such proposed mission submitted to his squadron, and protested fiercely after being grounded following his second sortie which ended with a demolished P-38. His connections in high places, plus a publishing agreement with Life Magazine, were instrumental in having the grounding order against him lifted.[77] For some time Saint-Exupéry's friends, colleagues, and compatriots were actively working to keep the aging, accident-prone author grounded, out of harm's way.\n^ In 2009, the director of the Village Petite France (Little France Village) in South Korea stated that there were 350 different editions of Orin Wanja (The Little Prince) in Korean, including editions in Manga.[95]\n^ A further complication occurred due to Saint-Exupéry's opinions of French General Charles de Gaulle, whom he held in low regard. Even though both men were working to free France from Nazi occupation, Saint-Exupéry saw de Gaulle with apprehension and consequently provided no public support to the General. In response, de Gaulle struck back at the author by implying that the author was a German supporter, and then had all his literary works banned in France's North African colonies. Saint-Exupéry's writings were, with irony, banned simultaneously in both occupied France and Free France.[99][74]\n^ Although Macaulay Culkin had been earning approximately $8 million per film project at that point, he provided his narration to the museum \"for nothing, and we are grateful for his services\", according to a Morgan representative.[130]\n^ The d'Gay portion of the estate refers to Saint-Exupéry's married sister.\n^ Orson Welles purchased the movie rights to the story the day after reading the novella in a single sitting.[61] Welles was unable to persuade Walt Disney to assist him in turning his screenplay of the story into a film, with Disney fearing such a screen release would upstage his own screen adaptations of other stories.\n^ The signed copy is inscribed \"For Stephen, to whom I have already spoken about The Little Prince, and who perhaps will be his friend\".[58]^ de Saint-Exupéry & Woods 1943.\n^ a b genome.ch.bbc.co.uk, accessed 9 October 2021 Cite error: The named reference \"genome.ch.bbc.co.uk\" was defined multiple times with different content (see the help page).\n^ de Saint-Exupéry & Cuffe 2006.\n^ de Saint-Exupéry & Morpurgo 2018.\n^ de Saint-Exupéry & Testot-Ferry 2018.\n^ a b c \"'Definitive' Translation of 'Le Petit Prince'\", New Straits Times, 20 September 2000.

{"title":"The Lord of the Rings","author":"J. R. R. Tolkien","published":1954,"fiction":true,"plot":"The Fellowship of the Ring\n[edit]Further information: The Fellowship of the Ring § ContentsBilbo Baggins celebrates his birthday and leaves the Ring to Frodo, his heir. Gandalf (a wizard) suspects it is a Ring of Power; seventeen years later, he confirms it is the One Ring, lost by the Dark Lord Sauron, and counsels Frodo to take it away from the Shire. Gandalf leaves, promising to return, but fails to do so. Frodo sets out on foot with his cousin Pippin Took and gardener Sam Gamgee. They are pursued by Black Riders, but meet some Elves, whose singing to Elbereth wards off the Riders. The Hobbits take an evasive shortcut to Bucklebury Ferry, where they meet their friend Merry Brandybuck. Merry and Pippin reveal they know about the Ring and insist on joining Frodo on his journey. They try to shake off the Black Riders by cutting through the Old Forest. Merry and Pippin are trapped by the malign Old Man Willow, but are rescued by Tom Bombadil. Leaving Tom's house, they are caught by a barrow-wight. Frodo, awakening from the barrow-wight's spell, calls Tom Bombadil, who frees them and gives them ancient swords from the wight's hoard. The Hobbits reach the village of Bree, where they meet Strider, a Ranger. The innkeeper gives Frodo an old letter from Gandalf, which identifies Strider as a friend. Knowing the Black Riders will attempt to seize the Ring, Strider guides the group toward the Elvish sanctuary of Rivendell. At Weathertop, they are attacked by five Black Riders. Their leader wounds Frodo with a cursed blade. Strider fights them off and treats Frodo with the herb athelas. They are joined by the Elf Glorfindel, who rides with Frodo, now deathly ill, towards Rivendell. The Black Riders pursue Frodo into the Ford of Bruinen, where they are swept away by flood waters summoned by Elrond.Frodo recovers in Rivendell under Elrond's care. Gandalf informs Frodo that the Black Riders are the Nazgûl, Men enslaved by Rings of Power to serve Sauron. The Council of Elrond discusses what to do with the Ring. Strider is revealed to be Aragorn, the heir of Isildur who had cut the Ring from Sauron's hand in the Second Age, but claimed it for himself. The Ring was lost when Isildur was killed; it passed to Gollum and then to Bilbo. Gandalf reports that the chief wizard, Saruman, is a traitor. The Council decides that the Ring must be destroyed in the fire of Mount Doom in Mordor, where it was forged. Frodo takes this task upon himself. Elrond chooses companions for him: Sam, Merry, and Pippin; Gandalf; the Men Aragorn and Boromir, son of the Steward of Gondor; the Elf Legolas; and the Dwarf Gimli, representing the Free Peoples of the West. After a failed attempt to cross the Misty Mountains, the Fellowship risk the path through the Mines of Moria. They learn that Balin and his Dwarves, who had attempted to regain possession of Moria, were killed by Orcs. They are attacked by Orcs and a Balrog, a fire demon. Gandalf confronts the Balrog: both fall into an abyss. The others escape to the Elvish forest of Lothlórien, where the Lady Galadriel tests their loyalty, and gives them magical gifts. She allows Frodo and Sam to look into her vision-giving fountain, the Mirror of Galadriel. Frodo offers her the Ring: she refuses, knowing that it would master her. Galadriel's husband Celeborn gives the Fellowship boats, cloaks, and waybread. They travel down the River Anduin. At Amon Hen, Boromir tries to take the Ring, but Frodo puts on the Ring and disappears. Frodo chooses to cross the river and go alone to Mordor, but Sam, guessing what he intends, intercepts and joins him.The Two Towers\n[edit]Further information: The Two Towers § ContentsA party of Orcs sent by Saruman and Sauron attack the Fellowship. Boromir tries to protect Merry and Pippin from the Orcs, but they kill him and capture the two Hobbits. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas decide to pursue the Orcs. The Orcs are killed by Riders of Rohan, led by Éomer. The Hobbits escape into Fangorn Forest, where they are befriended by the Ent Treebeard. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas track the hobbits to Fangorn, where they meet Gandalf: he explains that he killed the Balrog; he too was killed in the fight, but was sent back to Middle-earth. He is now Gandalf the White, replacing Saruman as chief of the wizards. They ride to Edoras, capital of Rohan. Gandalf frees King Théoden from the influence of Saruman's spy Gríma Wormtongue. Théoden musters his army and rides to the fortress of Helm's Deep; Gandalf departs to seek help from Treebeard. The Ents destroy Isengard, Saruman's stronghold, and flood it, trapping the wizard in the tower of Orthanc. Gandalf convinces Treebeard to send an army of Huorns to Théoden's aid. He brings an army of Riders of Rohan to Helm's Deep. They defeat the Orcs, who flee into the forest of Huorns and are destroyed. Gandalf, Théoden, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli ride to Isengard, where they find Merry and Pippin relaxing amidst the ruins. Gandalf offers Saruman a chance to turn away from evil. When Saruman refuses, Gandalf strips him of his rank and most of his powers. Wormtongue throws down a hard round object to try to kill Gandalf. Pippin picks it up; Gandalf swiftly takes it, but Pippin steals it in the night. It is a palantír, a seeing-stone that Saruman used to speak with Sauron, becoming ensnared. Sauron sees Pippin, but misunderstands the circumstances. Gandalf rides for Minas Tirith, chief city of Gondor, taking Pippin with him.Frodo and Sam struggle through the barren hills of the Emyn Muil. They realize they are being tracked; on a moonlit night they capture Gollum, who has followed them from Moria. Frodo makes Gollum swear to serve him, as Ringbearer, and asks him to guide them to Mordor. Gollum leads them across the Dead Marshes. Sam overhears Gollum debating with his alter ego, Sméagol, whether to steal the Ring. The Black Gate of Mordor is too well guarded, so they travel south through Ithilien to a secret pass that Gollum knows. They are captured by rangers led by Faramir, Boromir's brother, and brought to the secret fastness of Henneth Annûn. Faramir resists the temptation to seize the Ring and, disobeying orders to arrest strangers, releases them. Gollum guides the hobbits to the pass, but leads them into the lair of the great spider Shelob in the tunnels of Cirith Ungol. Frodo holds up his gift, the Phial of Galadriel, which holds the light of Eärendil's star: it drives Shelob back. Frodo cuts through a giant web using his sword Sting. Shelob attacks again, and Frodo falls to her venom. Sam picks up Sting and the Phial. He wounds the monster. Believing Frodo to be dead, a devastated Sam takes the Ring to continue the quest alone. Orcs take Frodo; Sam overhears them saying that Frodo is still alive, and sets out to rescue him.The Return of the King\n[edit]Further information: The Return of the King § ContentsSauron sends a great army against Gondor. Gandalf arrives at Minas Tirith to warn Denethor of the attack, while Théoden musters the Riders of Rohan to go to Gondor's aid. Minas Tirith is besieged; the Lord of the Nazgûl uses a spell-wound battering ram to destroy the city's gates. Denethor, deceived by Sauron, falls into despair. He burns himself alive on a pyre; Pippin and Gandalf rescue his son Faramir from the same fate. Aragorn, accompanied by Legolas, Gimli, and the Rangers of the North, takes the Paths of the Dead to recruit the Dead Men of Dunharrow, oathbreakers who will have no rest until they fight for the King of Gondor. Aragorn unleashes the Army of the Dead on the Corsairs of Umbar invading southern Gondor. He and men of southern Gondor sail in the Corsairs' ships up the Anduin, reaching Minas Tirith just in time to turn the tide of battle. Théoden's niece Éowyn, who joined the army in disguise, kills the Lord of the Nazgûl with help from Merry; both are wounded. Gondor and Rohan defeat Sauron's army in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, but Théoden is killed. Aragorn enters Minas Tirith and heals the sick. He leads an army through Ithilien to the Black Gate to distract Sauron from his true danger. At the Battle of the Morannon, his army is vastly outnumbered.Sam rescues Frodo from the tower of Cirith Ungol. They set out across Mordor. When they reach the edge of the Cracks of Doom, Frodo cannot resist the Ring any longer: he claims it for himself and puts it on. Gollum reappears. He bites off Frodo's Ring finger. Celebrating wildly, Gollum loses his footing and falls into the Fire, taking the Ring with him. When the Ring is destroyed, Sauron loses his power. All he created collapses, the Nazgûl perish, Aragorn wins the battle of the Morannon, and the Eagles rescue Frodo and Sam from the ruin of Mount Doom. Aragorn is crowned King, and weds Arwen, Elrond's daughter. Théoden is buried; Éomer is crowned King of Rohan. His sister Éowyn is engaged to Faramir, now Steward of Gondor and Prince of Ithilien. Galadriel, Celeborn, and Gandalf say farewell to Treebeard, and to Aragorn. The four hobbits travel home, only to find it has been taken over by Saruman's men. Merry raises a rebellion and scours the Shire. Saruman reveals crimes that Wormtongue has done, causing Wormtongue to turn on Saruman and kill him in front of Bag End, Frodo's home. Wormtongue then is killed by hobbit archers. Merry and Pippin are celebrated as heroes. Sam marries Rosie Cotton and uses his gifts to heal the Shire. Frodo, broken by the quest, leaves a few years later, sailing from the Grey Havens over the Sea to find peace.Extensive appendices outline more details of the history, cultures, genealogies, and languages that Tolkien imagined for the peoples of Middle-earth. In antiquarian style,[6] they provide background details for the narrative, with much detail for Tolkien fans who want to know more about the stories.Frame story\n[edit]Further information: Tolkien's frame storiesTolkien presents The Lord of the Rings within a fictional frame story where he is not the original author, but merely the translator of part of an ancient document, the Red Book of Westmarch.[7] That book is modelled on the real Red Book of Hergest, which similarly presents an older mythology. Various details of the frame story appear in the Prologue, its \"Note on Shire Records\", and in the Appendices, notably Appendix F. In this frame story, the Red Book is the purported source of Tolkien's other works relating to Middle-earth: The Hobbit, The Silmarillion, and The Adventures of Tom Bombadil.[8]Background\n[edit]Further information: Tolkien's legendariumAlthough a major work in itself, The Lord of the Rings was only the last movement of a much older set of narratives Tolkien had worked on since 1917 encompassing The Silmarillion,[9] in a process he described as mythopoeia.[e]The Lord of the Rings started as a sequel to Tolkien's work The Hobbit, published in 1937.[11] The popularity of The Hobbit led George Allen & Unwin, the publishers, to request a sequel. Tolkien warned them that he wrote quite slowly, and responded with several stories he had already developed. Having rejected his contemporary drafts for The Silmarillion, putting Roverandom on hold, and accepting Farmer Giles of Ham, Allen & Unwin continued to ask for more stories about hobbits.[12]Writing\n[edit]Main article: Constructing The Lord of the RingsPersuaded by his publishers, he started \"a new Hobbit\" in December 1937.[11] After several false starts, the story of the One Ring emerged. The idea for the first chapter (\"A Long-Expected Party\") arrived fully formed, although the reasons behind Bilbo's disappearance, the significance of the Ring, and the title The Lord of the Rings did not come until the spring of 1938.[11] Originally, he planned to write a story in which Bilbo had used up all his treasure and was looking for another adventure to gain more; however, he remembered the Ring and its powers and thought that would be a better focus for the new work.[11] As the story progressed, he brought in elements from The Silmarillion mythology.[13]Writing was slow, because Tolkien had a full-time academic position, marked exams to bring in a little extra income, and wrote many drafts.[11][T 4] Tolkien abandoned The Lord of the Rings during most of 1943 and only restarted it in April 1944,[11] as a serial for his son Christopher Tolkien, who was sent chapters as they were written while he was serving in South Africa with the Royal Air Force. Tolkien made another major effort in 1946 and showed the manuscript to his publishers in 1947.[11] The story was effectively finished the next year, but Tolkien did not complete the revision of earlier parts of the work until 1949.[11] The original manuscripts, which total 9,250 pages, now reside in the J. R. R. Tolkien Collection at Marquette University.[14]Poetry\n[edit]Main article: Poetry in The Lord of the RingsUnusually for 20th century novels, the prose narrative is supplemented throughout by over 60 pieces of poetry. These include verse and songs of many genres: for wandering, marching to war, drinking, and having a bath; narrating ancient myths, riddles, prophecies, and magical incantations; and of praise and lament (elegy).[15] Some, such as riddles, charms, elegies, and narrating heroic actions are found in Old English poetry.[15] Scholars have stated that the poetry is essential for the fiction to work aesthetically and thematically, as it adds information not given in the prose, and it brings out characters and their backgrounds.[16][17] The poetry has been judged to be of high technical skill, reflected in Tolkien's prose; for instance, he wrote much of Tom Bombadil's speech in metre.[18]Illustrations\n[edit]Main article: Non-narrative elements in The Lord of the RingsTolkien worked on the text using his maps of Middle-earth as a guide, to ensure the elements of the story fitted together in time and space.[T 5] He prepared a variety of types of illustration – maps, calligraphy, drawings, cover designs, even a facsimile painting of the Book of Mazarbul – but only the maps, the inscription on the Ring, and a drawing of the Doors of Durin were included in the first edition.[19][T 6]The hardback editions sometimes had cover illustrations by Tolkien,[f] sometimes by other artists. According to The New York Times, Barbara Remington's cover designs for Ballantine's paperback editions \"achieved mass-cult status in the 1960s, particularly on college campuses\" across America.[20]Influences\n[edit]Main article: J. R. R. Tolkien's influencesTolkien drew on a wide array of influences including language,[T 7] Christianity,[T 8]mythology and Germanic heroic legend including the Norse Völsunga saga,[22]archaeology, especially at the Temple of Nodens,[23] ancient and modern literature, like Finnish 19th-century epic poetry The Kalevala by Elias Lönnrot,[24] and personal experience. He was inspired primarily by his profession, philology;[T 9] his work centred on the study of Old English literature, especially Beowulf, and he acknowledged its importance to his writings.[21] He was a gifted linguist, influenced by Celtic,[25][22] Finnish,[26] Slavic,[27] and Greek language and mythology.[28] Commentators have attempted to identify literary and topological antecedents for characters, places and events in Tolkien's writings; he acknowledged that he had enjoyed adventure stories by authors such as John Buchan and Rider Haggard.[29][30][31] The Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris was a major influence,[T 10] and Tolkien undoubtedly made use of some real place-names, such as Bag End, the name of his aunt's home.[32] Tolkien stated, too, that he had been influenced by his childhood experiences of the English countryside of Worcestershire near Sarehole Mill, and its urbanization by the growth of Birmingham,[T 11] and his personal experience of fighting in the trenches of the First World War.[33] Moreover, the militarization and industrialization inspired the character of Sauron and his forces. The Orcs represented the worst of it as workers that have been tortured and brutalized by the war and industry.[34]Themes\n[edit]Main article: Themes of The Lord of the RingsScholars and critics have identified many themes in the book with its complex interlaced narrative, including a reversed quest,[35][36] the struggle of good and evil,[37]death and immortality,[38] fate and free will,[39]the addictive danger of power,[40] and various aspects of Christianity such as the presence of three Christ figures, for prophet, priest, and king, as well as elements like hope and redemptive suffering.[41][42][43][44] There is a common theme throughout the work of language, its sound, and its relationship to peoples and places, along with hints of providence in descriptions of weather and landscape.[45] Out of these, Tolkien stated that the central theme is death and immortality.[T 12] To those who supposed that the book was an allegory of events in the 20th century, Tolkien replied in the foreword to the Second Edition that it was not, saying he preferred \"history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers.\"Some commentators have criticized the book for being a story about men for boys, with no significant women; or about a purely rural world with no bearing on modern life in cities; of containing no sign of religion; or of racism. Other commentators responded by noting that there are three powerful women in the book, Galadriel, Éowyn, and Arwen; that life, even in rural Hobbiton, is not idealized; that Christianity is a pervasive theme; and that Tolkien was sharply anti-racist both in peacetime and during the Second World War, while Middle-earth is evidently polycultural.[46][47][48] Others have discussed the apparent or implicit sexuality in the book.[49][50][51]A dispute with his publisher, Allen & Unwin, led Tolkien to offer the work to William Collins in 1950. Tolkien intended The Silmarillion (itself largely unrevised at this point) to be published along with The Lord of the Rings, but Allen & Unwin was unwilling to do this. After Milton Waldman, his contact at Collins, expressed the belief that The Lord of the Rings itself \"urgently wanted cutting\", Tolkien eventually demanded that they publish the book in 1952.[52] Collins did not; and so Tolkien wrote to Allen & Unwin, telling that he would have gladly considered the publication of any part of the stuff, fearing his work would never see the light of day.[11]For publication, the work was divided into three volumes to minimize any potential financial loss due to the high cost of type-setting and modest anticipated sales: The Fellowship of the Ring (Books I and II), The Two Towers (Books III and IV), and The Return of the King (Books V and VI, and six appendices).[53] Delays in producing appendices, maps and especially an index led to the volumes being published later than originally hoped – on 29 July 1954, on 11 November 1954 and on 20 October 1955 respectively in the United Kingdom.[54] In the United States, Houghton Mifflin published The Fellowship of the Ring on 21 October 1954, The Two Towers on 21 April 1955, and The Return of the King on 5 January 1956.[55]The Return of the King was especially delayed as Tolkien revised the ending and prepared appendices (some of which had to be left out because of space constraints). Tolkien did not like the title The Return of the King, believing it gave away too much of the storyline, but deferred to his publisher's preference.[56] Tolkien wrote that the title The Two Towers \"can be left ambiguous\",[T 13] but considered naming the two as Orthanc and Barad-dûr, Minas Tirith and Barad-dûr, or Orthanc and the Tower of Cirith Ungol.[T 14] However, a month later he wrote a note published at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring and later drew a cover illustration, both of which identified the pair as Minas Morgul and Orthanc.[57][58]Tolkien was initially opposed to titles being given to each two-book volume, preferring instead the use of book titles: e.g. The Lord of the Rings: Vol. 1, The Ring Sets Out and The Ring Goes South; Vol. 2, The Treason of Isengard and The Ring Goes East; Vol. 3, The War of the Ring and The End of the Third Age. However, these individual book titles were dropped, and after pressure from his publishers, Tolkien suggested the volume titles: Vol. 1, The Shadow Grows; Vol. 2, The Ring in the Shadow; Vol. 3, The War of the Ring or The Return of the King.[59][60]Because the three-volume binding was so widely distributed, the work is often referred to as the Lord of the Rings \"trilogy\". In a letter to the poet W. H. Auden, who famously reviewed the final volume in 1956,[61] Tolkien himself made use of the term \"trilogy\" for the work[T 15] though he did at other times consider this incorrect, as it was written and conceived as a single book.[T 16] It is often called a novel; however, Tolkien objected to this term as he viewed it as a heroic romance.[T 17]The books were published under a profit-sharing arrangement, whereby Tolkien would not receive an advance or royalties until the books had broken even, after which he would take a large share of the profits.[62] It has ultimately become one of the best-selling novels ever written, with at least 50 million copies sold by 2003[63] and over 150 million copies sold by 2007.[2] The work was published in the UK by Allen & Unwin until 1990, when the publisher and its assets were acquired by HarperCollins.[64][65]Editions and revisions\n[edit]In the early 1960s Donald A. Wollheim, science fiction editor of the paperback publisher Ace Books, claimed that The Lord of the Rings was not protected in the United States under American copyright law because Houghton Mifflin, the US hardcover publisher, had neglected to copyright the work in the United States.[68][69] Then, in 1965, Ace Books proceeded to publish an edition, unauthorized by Tolkien and without paying royalties to him. Tolkien took issue with this and quickly notified his fans of this objection.[70]Grass-roots pressure from these fans became so great that Ace Books withdrew their edition and made a nominal payment to Tolkien.[71][T 18]Authorized editions followed from Ballantine Books and Houghton Mifflin to tremendous commercial success. Tolkien undertook various textual revisions to produce a version of the book that would be published with his consent and establish an unquestioned US copyright. This text became the Second Edition of The Lord of the Rings, published in 1965.[71] The first Ballantine paperback edition was printed in October that year, selling a quarter of a million copies within ten months. On 4 September 1966, the novel debuted on The New York Times's Paperback Bestsellers list as number three, and was number one by 4 December, a position it held for eight weeks.[72] Houghton Mifflin editions after 1994 consolidate variant revisions by Tolkien, and corrections supervised by Christopher Tolkien, which resulted, after some initial glitches, in a computer-based unified text.[73]In 2004, for the 50th Anniversary Edition, Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, under supervision from Christopher Tolkien, studied and revised the text to eliminate as many errors and inconsistencies as possible, some of which had been introduced by well-meaning compositors of the first printing in 1954, and never been corrected.[74] The 2005 edition of the book contained further corrections noticed by the editors and submitted by readers. Yet more corrections were made in the 60th Anniversary Edition in 2014.[75] Several editions, including the 50th Anniversary Edition, print the whole work in one volume, with the result that pagination varies widely over the various editions.[T 19]Posthumous publication of drafts\n[edit]From 1988 to 1992 Christopher Tolkien published the surviving drafts of The Lord of the Rings, chronicling and illuminating with commentary the stages of the text's development, in volumes 6–9 of his History of Middle-earth series. The four volumes carry the titles The Return of the Shadow, The Treason of Isengard, The War of the Ring, and Sauron Defeated.[76]Translations\n[edit]Further information: Translating The Lord of the RingsSee also: List of translations of The Lord of the RingsThe work has been translated, with varying degrees of success, into at least 38,[d] and reportedly at least 70, languages.[77] Tolkien, an expert in philology, examined many of these translations, and made comments on each that reflect both the translation process and his work. As he was unhappy with some choices made by early translators, such as the Swedish translation by Åke Ohlmarks,[T 20] Tolkien wrote a \"Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings\" (1967). Because The Lord of the Rings purports to be a translation of the fictitious Red Book of Westmarch, using the English language to represent the Westron of the \"original\", Tolkien suggested that translators attempt to capture the interplay between English and the invented nomenclature of the English work, and gave several examples along with general guidance.[78][79]Main article: Literary reception of The Lord of the Rings1950s\n[edit]Early reviews of the work were mixed. The initial review in the Sunday Telegraph described it as \"among the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century\".[80] The Sunday Times echoed this sentiment, stating that \"the English-speaking world is divided into those who have read The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit and those who are going to read them.\"[80] The New York Herald Tribune appeared to predict the books' popularity, writing in its review that they were \"destined to outlast our time\".[81]W. H. Auden, a former pupil of Tolkien's and an admirer of his writings, regarded The Lord of the Rings as a \"masterpiece\", further stating that in some cases it outdid the achievement of John Milton's Paradise Lost.[82] Kenneth F. Slater wrote in Nebula Science Fiction, April 1955, \"... if you don't read it, you have missed one of the finest books of its type ever to appear\".[83][84] On the other hand, in 1955, the Scottish poet Edwin Muir attacked The Return of the King, writing that \"All the characters are boys masquerading as adult heroes ... and will never come to puberty ... Hardly one of them knows anything about women\", causing Tolkien to complain angrily to his publisher.[85] In 1956, the literary critic Edmund Wilson wrote a review entitled \"Oo, Those Awful Orcs!\", calling Tolkien's work \"juvenile trash\", and saying \"Dr. Tolkien has little skill at narrative and no instinct for literary form.\"[86]Within Tolkien's literary group, The Inklings, the work had a mixed reception. Hugo Dyson complained loudly at its readings,[87][g] whereas C. S. Lewis had very different feelings, writing, \"here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron. Here is a book which will break your heart.\"[9] Lewis observed that the writing is rich, in that some of the 'good' characters have darker sides, and likewise some of the villains have \"good impulses\".[88] Despite the mixed reviews and the lack of a paperback until the 1960s, The Lord of the Rings initially sold well in hardback.[9]Later\n[edit]Further information: Tolkien's prose style and Literary hostility to J. R. R. TolkienJudith Shulevitz, writing in The New York Times, criticized the \"pedantry\" of Tolkien's literary style, saying that he \"formulated a high-minded belief in the importance of his mission as a literary preservationist, which turns out to be death to literature itself\".[89] The critic Richard Jenkyns, writing in The New Republic, criticized the work for a lack of psychological depth. Both the characters and the work itself were, according to Jenkyns, \"anemic, and lacking in fibre\".[90] The science fiction author David Brin interprets the work as holding unquestioning devotion to a traditional hierarchical social structure.[91] In his essay \"Epic Pooh\", fantasy author Michael Moorcock critiques the world-view displayed by the book as deeply conservative, in both the \"paternalism\" of the narrative voice and the power structures in the narrative.[92]Tom Shippey, like Tolkien an English philologist, notes the wide gulf between Tolkien's supporters, both popular and academic, and his literary detractors, and attempts to explain in detail both why the literary establishment disliked The Lord of the Rings, and the work's subtlety, themes, and merits, including the impression of depth that it conveys.[13] The scholar of humanities Brian Rosebury analysed Tolkien's prose style in detail, showing that it was generally quite plain, varying to suit the voices of the different characters, and rising to a heroic register for special moments.[93] The critic Patrick Curry cited the work's first publisher, Rayner Unwin's \"pithy and accurate\" assessment of the novel: \"a very great book in its own curious way\".[94]Awards\n[edit]In 1957, The Lord of the Rings was awarded the International Fantasy Award. Despite its numerous detractors, the publication of the Ace Books and Ballantine paperbacks helped The Lord of the Rings become immensely popular in the United States in the 1960s. The book has remained so ever since, ranking as the most popular works of fiction of the twentieth century, judged by all of three different measures: sales, library borrowings, and reader surveys.[95][96] In the 2003 \"Big Read\" survey conducted in Britain by the BBC, The Lord of the Rings was found to be the \"Nation's best-loved book\". In similar 2004 polls both Germany[97] and Australia[98] chose The Lord of the Rings as their favourite book. In a 1999 poll of Amazon.com customers, The Lord of the Rings was judged to be their favourite \"book of the millennium\".[99] In 2019, the BBC News listed The Lord of the Rings on its list of the \"100 most inspiring novels\".[100]Main article: Adaptations of The Lord of the RingsThe Lord of the Rings has been adapted into various media, including radio, stage, motion pictures, and videogames.Radio\n[edit]The book has been adapted for radio four times. In 1955 and 1956, the BBC broadcast The Lord of the Rings, a 13-part radio adaptation of the story. In the 1960s radio station WBAI produced a short radio adaptation. A 1979 dramatization of The Lord of the Rings was broadcast in the United States and subsequently issued on tape and CD. In 1981, the BBC broadcast The Lord of the Rings, a new dramatization in 26 half-hour instalments.[101][102]Motion pictures\n[edit]Main articles: Middle-earth in motion pictures and Peter Jackson's interpretation of The Lord of the RingsA variety of filmmakers considered adapting Tolkien's book, among them Stanley Kubrick, who thought it unfilmable,[103][104]Michelangelo Antonioni,[105]Jim Henson,[106]Heinz Edelmann,[107] and John Boorman.[108] A Swedish live action television film, Sagan om ringen, was broadcast in 1971.[109] In 1978, Ralph Bakshi made an animated film version covering The Fellowship of the Ring and part of The Two Towers, to mixed reviews.[110] In 1980, Rankin/Bass released an animated TV special based on the closing chapters of The Return of the King, gaining mixed reviews.[111][112] The 1991 Soviet Union live-action adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring, Khraniteli, was aired once and thought lost,[113][114] but was rediscovered and republished on the Web. It includes Tom Bombadil and the Barrow-wight, omitted from Jackson's version.[115] In Finland, a live action television miniseries, Hobitit, was broadcast in 1993 based on The Lord of the Rings, with a flashback to Bilbo's encounter with Gollum in The Hobbit.[116][117]A far more successful adaptation was Peter Jackson's live action The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, produced by New Line Cinema and released in three instalments as The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003). All three parts won multiple Academy Awards, including consecutive Best Picture nominations. The final instalment of this trilogy was the second film to break the one-billion-dollar barrier and won a total of 11 Oscars (something only two other films in history, Ben-Hur and Titanic, have accomplished), including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.[118][119] Commentators including Tolkien scholars, literary critics and film critics are divided on how faithfully Jackson adapted Tolkien's work, or whether a film version is inevitably different, and if so the reasons for any changes, and the effectiveness of the result.[120]The Hunt for Gollum, a 2009 film by Chris Bouchard,[121][122] and the 2009 Born of Hope, written by Paula DiSante and directed by Kate Madison, are fan films based on details in the appendices of The Lord of the Rings.[123]From September 2022, Amazon has been presenting a multi-season television series of stories, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. It is set at the beginning of the Second Age, long before the time of The Lord of the Rings, based on materials in the novel's appendices.[124][125][126]In 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery began making a series of films set in Middle-earth, produced along with New Line Cinema and Freemode.[127] The first was The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, an anime written by Jeffrey Addiss, Will Matthews and Philippa Boyens, directed by Kenji Kamiyama and released in December 2024. It was based on the story of the legendary Rohan king Helm Hammerhand.[128][129][130]Audiobooks\n[edit]In 1990, Recorded Books published an audio version of The Lord of the Rings,[131] read by the British actor Rob Inglis. A large-scale musical theatre adaptation, The Lord of the Rings, was first staged in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 2006 and opened in London in June 2007; it was a commercial failure.[132]In 2013, the artist Phil Dragash recorded the whole of the book, using the score from Peter Jackson's movies.[133][134][135]During the COVID-19 lockdown, Andy Serkis read the entire book of The Hobbit online to raise money for charity.[136] He then recorded the work again as an audiobook.[137] The cover art was done by Alan Lee. In 2021, Serkis recorded The Lord of the Rings novels.[138]Further information: Works inspired by J. R. R. TolkienInfluence on fantasy\n[edit]Main article: Tolkien's impact on fantasyThe enormous popularity of Tolkien's work expanded the demand for fantasy. Largely thanks to The Lord of the Rings, the genre flowered throughout the 1960s and enjoys popularity to the present day.[139] The opus has spawned many imitations, such as The Sword of Shannara, which Lin Carter called \"the single most cold-blooded, complete rip-off of another book that I have ever read,\"[140] as well as alternate interpretations of the story, such as The Last Ringbearer. The Legend of Zelda, which popularized the action-adventure game genre in the 1980s, was inspired by The Lord of the Rings among other fantasy books.[141][142]Dungeons & Dragons, which popularized the role-playing game genre in the 1970s, features several races from The Lord of the Rings, including halflings (hobbits), elves, dwarves, half-elves, orcs, and dragons. However, Gary Gygax, the lead designer of the game, stated that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the popularity the work enjoyed at the time he was developing the game.[143] Because Dungeons & Dragons has gone on to influence many popular games, especially role-playing video games, the influence of The Lord of the Rings extends to many of them, with titles such as Dragon Quest,[144][145]EverQuest, the Warcraft series, and The Elder Scrolls series of games[146] as well as video games set in Middle-earth itself.Music\n[edit]Main article: Music of Middle-earthIn 1965, the composer and songwriter Donald Swann, best known for his collaboration with Michael Flanders as Flanders & Swann, set six poems from The Lord of the Rings and one from The Adventures of Tom Bombadil (\"Errantry\") to music. When Swann met with Tolkien to play the songs for his approval, Tolkien suggested for \"Namárië\" (Galadriel's lament) a setting reminiscent of plain chant, which Swann accepted.[147] The songs were published in 1967 as The Road Goes Ever On: A Song Cycle,[148] and a recording of the songs performed by singer William Elvin with Swann on piano was issued that same year by Caedmon Records as Poems and Songs of Middle Earth.[149]Rock bands of the 1970s were musically and lyrically inspired by the fantasy-embracing counter-culture of the time. The British rock band Led Zeppelin recorded several songs that contain explicit references to The Lord of the Rings, such as mentioning Gollum and Mordor in \"Ramble On\", the Misty Mountains in \"Misty Mountain Hop\", and Ringwraiths in \"The Battle of Evermore\". In 1970, the Swedish musician Bo Hansson released an instrumental concept album entitled Sagan om ringen (\"The Saga of the Ring\", the title of the Swedish translation at the time).[150] The album was subsequently released internationally as Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings in 1972.[150] From the 1980s onwards, many heavy metal acts have been influenced by Tolkien.[151]In 1988, the Dutch composer and trombonist Johan de Meij completed his Symphony No. 1 \"The Lord of the Rings\". It had 5 movements, titled \"Gandalf\", \"Lothlórien\", \"Gollum\", \"Journey in the Dark\", and \"Hobbits\".[152] The 1991 album Shepherd Moons by the Irish musician Enya contains an instrumental titled \"Lothlórien\", in reference to the home of the wood-elves.[153]Impact on popular culture\n[edit]Further information: Impact of Tolkien's mythologyThe Lord of the Rings has had a profound and wide-ranging impact on popular culture, beginning with its publication in the 1950s, but especially during the 1960s and 1970s, when young people embraced it as a countercultural saga.[154] \"Frodo Lives!\" and \"Gandalf for President\" were two phrases popular among United States Tolkien fans during this time.[155] Its impact is such that the words \"Tolkienian\" and \"Tolkienesque\" have entered the Oxford English Dictionary, and many of his fantasy terms, formerly little-known in English, such as \"Orc\" and \"Warg\", have become widespread in that domain.[156] Among its effects are numerous parodies, especially Harvard Lampoon's Bored of the Rings, which has had the distinction of remaining continuously in print from its publication in 1969, and of being translated into at least 11 languages.[157]In 1969, Tolkien sold the merchandising rights to The Lord of The Rings and The Hobbit to United Artists under an agreement stipulating a lump sum payment of £10,000[158] (equivalent to £208,000 in 2023) plus a 7.5% royalty after costs,[159] payable to Allen & Unwin and the author.[160] In 1976, three years after the author's death, United Artists sold the rights to Saul Zaentz Company, who now trade as Tolkien Enterprises. Since then all \"authorised\" merchandise has been signed off by Tolkien Enterprises, although the intellectual property rights of the specific likenesses of characters and other imagery from various adaptations is generally held by the adaptors.[161]Outside commercial exploitation from adaptations, from the late 1960s onwards there has been an increasing variety of original licensed merchandise, with posters and calendars created by illustrators such as Barbara Remington.[162]The work was named Britain's best novel of all time in the BBC's The Big Read.[163] In 2015, the BBC ranked The Lord of the Rings 26th on its list of the 100 greatest British novels.[164] It was included in Le Monde's list of \"100 Books of the Century\".[165]^ J. R. R. Tolkien disliked having the word \"novel\" applied to his works, preferring the phrase \"heroic romance\", but \"novel\" is commonly applied.[T 1]\n^ Tolkien has the wizard Gandalf say to the hobbit Frodo \"the Black Riders are the Ringwraiths, the Nine Servants of the Lord of the Rings.\"[T 2]\n^ Volume I: Prologue, The Ring Sets Out, The Ring Goes South; Volume II: The Treason of Isengard, The Ring Goes East; Volume III: The War of the Ring, The End of the Third Age, Appendices A–F.\n^ a b At least 38 languages are listed at the FAQ. This number is a very conservative estimate; some 56 translations are listed at translations of The Lord of the Rings, and 57 languages are listed at Elrond's Library.\n^ Tolkien created the word to define a different view of myth from C.

{"title":"And Then There Were None","author":"Agatha Christie","published":1939,"fiction":true,"plot":"Eight people arrive on a small, isolated island off the Devon coast, each having received an unexpected invitation. They are met by the butler and housekeeper, Thomas and Ethel Rogers, who explain that their hosts, Mr and Mrs Owen, have not yet arrived. A framed copy of an old rhyme hangs in every guest's room, and on the dining room table sit ten figurines. Acting on written instructions, Mr Rogers puts on a gramophone record, which accuses all ten people present of having committed murder. The guests realise that none of them know the Owens. Anthony Marston finishes his drink and promptly dies from cyanide poisoning.The next morning, Mrs Rogers is found dead in her bed. Suspecting their unknown host, some of the guests search the island, but find nobody else. After General MacArthur dies from a blow to the head, the guests conclude that one of the seven remaining persons must be responsible. The following day, Mr Rogers is found dead at the woodpile, having been attacked with an axe, and Emily Brent is found dead in the drawing room, having been injected with potassium cyanide. The guests realise that one figurine in the dining room is being removed after each death, and that the manner of the deaths corresponds with the wording of the rhyme.Mr Justice Wargrave suggests that all drugs and firearms should be secured, and that everyone should submit to a search. Philip Lombard's gun cannot be found. That evening, Vera Claythorne goes up to her room and screams when she finds seaweed hanging from the ceiling. Most of the remaining guests rush upstairs; when they return they find Wargrave in his chair, wearing his judicial wig and scarlet robes. Dr Armstrong pronounces him dead from a gunshot wound to the forehead. That night, Lombard's gun is returned, William Blore sees someone leaving the house, and Armstrong mysteriously disappears.After breakfast next morning, Vera, Lombard, and Blore go out. When Blore returns for food, he is killed by a bear-shaped marble clock that falls from Vera's window sill. Vera and Lombard find Armstrong's drowned body washed up on the beach, and each concludes the other must be responsible. Vera suggests moving Armstrong's body, and then grabs Lombard's gun and shoots him dead. Believing she is now safe, Vera returns to the house, only to find a noose and chair set up in her room. Recalling the last line of the rhyme, she hangs herself.Scotland Yard officials arrive to find ten bodies. They discover that a sleazy agent named Isaac Morris had purchased the island and made the arrangements on behalf of an unknown buyer. While the guests were on the island, Morris had died from an overdose of barbiturates, leaving nothing to indicate the buyer's identity. From the victims' diaries, the police reconstruct the first six deaths. They deduce that neither Armstrong, Lombard, nor Vera could have been the last person alive, as objects had been moved after their deaths, and they consider Blore's death unlikely to have been suicide. All indications are that no one else was on the island during this time, leaving the police mystified.A sealed bottle is recovered from the sea, containing a written confession by Wargrave. He reveals that all his life he had possessed both a strong sense of justice and a savage bloodlust, contradictory impulses he had satisfied by becoming a judge and sentencing criminals to death. After a terminal medical diagnosis, he decided to mete out his version of justice to individuals he considered had escaped legal punishment. He hired Morris to make the arrangements, then tricked him into overdosing. Posing as one of the invited guests, he included a charge against himself in the gramophone recording. Once it became clear that the killer was one of the group, Wargrave tricked Dr Armstrong into helping him fake his own death as part of a fictitious scheme to trap the murderer into incriminating himself. After all the others were dead, Wargrave shot himself, making sure that his true death matched his staged death recorded in the guests' diaries, so that investigators would be left with \"ten dead bodies and an unsolved problem\".The plot is structured around the ten lines of the rhyme \"Ten Little Niggers\",[3] a popular 1869 minstrel song written for the Christie Minstrels by the British songwriter Frank Green.[9] Green had modelled his lyrics on an American comic song \"Ten Little Indians\" [or Injuns][10][11] by Septimus Winner that had been published the year before.[12] In later editions of the novel, the characters of the rhyme are replaced by \"Ten Little Indians\" or \"Ten Little Soldier Boys\".This is the rhyme as published in a British 2008 edition:[13]Each of the ten victims – eight guests plus the island's two caretakers – is killed in a manner that reflects one of the lines of the rhyme. A sleazy agent who helped arrange the affair is also killed, but his killing occurs on the mainland and outside of the main storyline.Correspondence between rhyme and modes of death\n[edit]Writing for The Times Literary Supplement of 11 November 1939, Maurice Percy Ashley stated, \"If her latest story has scarcely any detection in it there is no scarcity of murders ... There is a certain feeling of monotony inescapable in the regularity of the deaths which is better suited to a serialized newspaper story than a full-length novel. Yet there is an ingenious problem to solve in naming the murderer\", he continued. \"It will be an extremely astute reader who guesses correctly.\"[14]For The New York Times Book Review (25 February 1940), Isaac Anderson has arrived to the point where \"the voice\" accuses the ten \"guests\" of their past crimes, which have all resulted in the deaths of humans, and then said, \"When you read what happens after that you will not believe it, but you will keep on reading, and as one incredible event is followed by another even more incredible you will still keep on reading. The whole thing is utterly impossible and utterly fascinating. It is the most baffling mystery that Agatha Christie has ever written, and if any other writer has ever surpassed it for sheer puzzlement the name escapes our memory. We are referring, of course, to mysteries that have logical explanations, as this one has. It is a tall story, to be sure, but it could have happened.\"[15]Many compared the book to her 1926 novel The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. For instance, an unnamed reviewer in the Toronto Daily Star of 16 March 1940 said, \"Others have written better mysteries than Agatha Christie, but no one can touch her for ingenious plot and surprise ending. With And Then There Were None ... she is at her most ingenious and most surprising ... is, indeed, considerably above the standard of her last few works and close to the Roger Ackroyd level.\"[16]Other critics laud the use of plot twists and surprise endings. Maurice Richardson wrote a rhapsodic review in The Observer's issue of 5 November 1939 which began, \"No wonder Agatha Christie's latest has sent her publishers into a vatic trance. We will refrain, however, from any invidious comparisons with Roger Ackroyd and be content with saying that Ten Little Niggers is one of the very best, most genuinely bewildering Christies yet written. We will also have to refrain from reviewing it thoroughly, as it is so full of shocks that even the mildest revelation would spoil some surprise from somebody, and I am sure that you would rather have your entertainment kept fresh than criticism pure.\" After stating the set-up of the plot, Richardson concluded, \"Story telling and characterisation are right at the top of Mrs Christie's baleful form. Her plot may be highly artificial, but it is neat, brilliantly cunning, soundly constructed, and free from any of those red-herring false trails which sometimes disfigure her work.\"[3]Robert Barnard, writing in 1990, concurred with the early reviews, describing the book as \"Suspenseful and menacing detective-story-cum-thriller. The closed setting with the succession of deaths is here taken to its logical conclusion, and the dangers of ludicrousness and sheer reader-disbelief are skillfully avoided. Probably the best-known Christie, and justifiably among the most popular.\"[17]The original title of the mystery (Ten Little Niggers) was changed because it was offensive. Alison Light, a literary critic and feminist scholar, opined that Christie's original title and the setting on \"Nigger Island\" (later changed to \"Indian Island\" and \"Soldier Island\", variously) were integral to the work. These aspects of the novel, she argued, \"could be relied upon automatically to conjure up a thrilling 'otherness', a place where revelations about the 'dark side' of the English would be appropriate.\"[18] Unlike novels such as Heart of Darkness, \"Christie's location is both more domesticated and privatized, taking for granted the construction of racial fears woven into psychic life as early as the nursery. If her story suggests how easy it is to play upon such fears, it is also a reminder of how intimately tied they are to sources of pleasure and enjoyment.\"[18]In 1990 Crime Writers' Association ranked And Then There Were None 19th in their The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time list. In 1995 in a similar list Mystery Writers of America ranked the novel 10th.[19] In September 2015, to mark her 125th birthday, And Then There Were None was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate.[20][21]In the \"Binge!\" article of Entertainment Weekly Issue #1343–44 (26 December 2014 – 3 January 2015), the writers picked And Then There Were None as an \"EW favorite\" on the list of the \"Nine Great Christie Novels\".[22]Christie's own assessment\n[edit]\"I had written the book Ten Little Niggers because it was so difficult to do that the idea had fascinated me. Ten people had to die without it becoming ridiculous or the murderer being obvious. I wrote the book after a tremendous amount of planning, and I was pleased with what I had made of it. It was clear, straightforward, baffling, and yet had a perfectly reasonable explanation; in fact, it had to have an epilogue in order to explain it. It was well received and reviewed, but the person who was really pleased with it was myself, for I knew better than any critic how difficult it had been ... I don't say it is the play or book of mine that I like best, or even that I think it is my best, but I do think in some ways that it is a better piece of craftsmanship than anything else I have written.\"[23]The novel has a long and noteworthy history of publication. It is a continuously best selling novel in English and in translation to other languages since its initial publication. From the start, in English, it was published under two different titles, due to different sensitivity to the author's title in the UK and in the US at first publication.The novel was originally published in late 1939 and early 1940 almost simultaneously, in the United Kingdom and the United States. The serialization was in 23 parts in the Daily Express from Tuesday 6 June to Saturday 1 July 1939. All of the instalments carried an illustration by \"Prescott\" with the first having an illustration of Burgh Island in Devon which inspired the setting of the story. The serialized version did not contain any chapter divisions.[24] The book retailed for seven shillings and sixpence.Title\n[edit]In the UK the book first appeared under the title Ten Little Niggers, in book and newspaper serialized formats. In the United States it was published under the title And Then There Were None, in both book and serial formats. Both of the original US publications changed the title from that originally used in the UK, due to the offensiveness of the word in American culture, where it was more widely perceived as a racially loaded ethnic slur or insult compared to the contemporaneous culture in the United Kingdom. The serialized version appeared in the Saturday Evening Post in seven parts from 20 May (Volume 211, Number 47) to 1 July 1939 (Volume 212, Number 1) with illustrations by Henry Raleigh, and the book was published in January 1940 by Dodd, Mead and Company for $2.[4][5][6]In the original UK novel, and in succeeding publications until 1985, all references to \"Indians\" or \"Soldiers\" were originally \"Nigger\", including the island's name, the pivotal rhyme found by the visitors, and the ten figurines.[5] UK editions continued to use the original title until the current definitive title appeared with a reprint of the 1963 Fontana Paperback in 1985.[7]The word \"nigger\" was already racially offensive in the United States by the start of the 20th century, and therefore the book's first US edition (1940) and first serialization changed the title to And Then There Were None and removed all references to the word from the book, as did the 1945 motion picture (except that the first US edition retained the phrase \"nigger in the woodpile\" in Chapter 2 Part VII and Chapter 7 Part III). Sensitivity to the original title of the novel was remarked by Sadie Stein in 2016, commenting on a BBC mini series with the title And Then There Were None, where she noted that \"even in 1939, this title was considered too offensive for American publication.\"[25] In general, \"Christie's work is not known for its racial sensitivity, and by modern standards her oeuvre is rife with casual Orientalism.\"[25] The original title was based on a rhyme from minstrel shows and children's games. Stein quotes Alison Light as to the power of the original name of the island in the novel, Nigger Island, \"to conjure up a thrilling 'otherness', a place where revelations about the 'dark side' of the English would be appropriate\".[26] Light goes on to say that \"Christie's location [the island] is both more domesticated and privatised, taking for granted the construction of racial fears woven into psychic life as early as the nursery.\"[26] Speaking of the \"widely known\" 1945 film, Stein added that \"we're merely faced with fantastic amounts of violence, and a rhyme so macabre and distressing one doesn't hear it now outside of the Agatha Christie context.\"[25] She felt that the original title of the novel in the UK, seen now, \"jars, viscerally\".[25]Best-selling crime novel\n[edit]And Then There Were None is the best-selling crime novel of all time, and made Agatha Christie the best-selling novelist, according to the Agatha Christie Estate.[2]It is Christie's best-selling novel, with more than 100 million copies sold; it is also the world's best-selling mystery and one of the best-selling books of all time. Publications International lists the novel as the seventh best-selling title of all time.[8]Editions in English\n[edit]The book and its adaptations have been released under various new names since the original publication, including Ten Little Indians (1946 play, Broadway performance and 1964 paperback book), Ten Little Soldiers, and official title per the Agatha Christie Limited website, And Then There Were None.[2] UK editions continued to use the work's original title until the 1980s; the first UK edition to use the alternative title And Then There Were None appeared in 1985 with a reprint of the 1963 Fontana Paperback.[7]Foreign-language editions\n[edit]Many older translations were based on the original British text, although the word used to translate nigger was often somewhat less offensive, more analogous to English negro or negrito. Languages where the most recent edition retains racial epithets include Spanish, Greek, Serbian, Bulgarian, Romanian,[28] and Russian,[29] as well as the 1987 Soviet film adaptation Desyat Negrityat. Changes similar to those in the British edition in the 1980s were made to the German novel in 2003,[n 1] after 2002 protests in Hanover against a stage version using the old title.[30] Similar changes were made in Dutch in 2004,[n 2]Swedish in 2007,[n 3]Brazilian Portuguese in 2009,[n 4]Polish in 2017,[n 5]French [n 6] Hungarian in 2020,[n 7] and Turkish in 2021.[n 8] In 1999, the Slovak National Theatre changed the title of a stage adaptation mid-run.[n 9] The estate of Agatha Christie now offers it under only one title in English, And Then There Were None,[2] and translations increasingly use the equivalent of this as their title.[34]European Portuguese translations have been titled Convite Para a Morte (1948: \"An Invitation to Death\") and As Dez Figuras Negras (2011: \"The Ten Black Figures\" – referring to the figurines, in this case minimally anthropomorphic).[34] The Finnish translation Eikä yksikään pelastunut (\"No one was saved\") in 1940 had its title taken from the American first edition, before being renamed Kymmenen pientä neekeripoikaa (\"Ten little negro boys\") in 1968. This change was reversed in 2003.[40]The 1930 novel The Invisible Host by Gwen Bristow and Bruce Manning has a plot that strongly matches that of Christie's later novel, including a recorded voice announcing to the guests that their sins will be visited upon them by death. The Invisible Host was adapted as the 1930 Broadway play The Ninth Guest by Owen Davis,[41] which itself was adapted as the 1934 film The Ninth Guest. There is no evidence Christie saw either the play (which had a brief run on Broadway) or the film.The 1933 K.B.S. Productions Sherlock Holmes film A Study in Scarlet follows a strikingly similar plot;[42] the victims are tormented by slips of paper inspired by the same poem used in Christie's novel. One says \"Six Little Black Boys | Playing With a Hive | A Bumble-Bee Stung One | And Then There Were Five.\" As in Christie's book, the killer turns out to be one of the \"victims\" who had appeared to be dead. The film retained no plot points from Arthur Conan Doyle's original story of the same name. The author of the movie's screenplay, Robert Florey, \"doubted that [Christie] had seen A Study in Scarlet, but he regarded it as a compliment if it had helped inspire her\".[43]And Then There Were None has had more adaptations than any other work by Agatha Christie.[2] Christie herself changed the bleak ending to a more palatable one for theatre audiences when she adapted the novel for the stage in 1943. Many adaptations incorporate changes to the story, such as using Christie's alternative ending from her stage play or changing the setting to locations other than an island.Film\n[edit]There have been numerous film adaptations of the novel:Radio\n[edit]The BBC broadcast Ten Little Niggers (1947), adapted by Ayton Whitaker, first aired as a Monday Matinee on the BBC Home Service on 27 December 1947 and as Saturday Night Theatre on the BBC Light Programme on 29 December.[49]On 13 November 2010, as part of its Saturday Play series, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 90-minute adaptation written by Joy Wilkinson. The production was directed by Mary Peate and featured Geoffrey Whitehead as Mr Justice Wargrave, Lyndsey Marshal as Vera Claythorne, Alex Wyndham as Philip Lombard, John Rowe as Dr Armstrong, and Joanna Monro as Emily Brent.Stage\n[edit]And Then There Were None (1943) is Christie's adaptation of the story for the stage. She and the producers agreed that audiences might not flock to a tale with such a grim ending as the novel, nor would it work well dramatically as there would be no one left to tell the story. Christie reworked the ending for Lombard and Vera to be innocent of the crimes of which they were accused, survive, and fall in love with each other. Some of the names were also changed, e.g., General MacArthur became General McKenzie in both the New York and London productions.[50][51] By 1943, General Douglas MacArthur was playing a prominent role in the Pacific Theatre of World War II, which may explain the change of the character's name.Ten Little Niggers (1944): Dundee Repertory Theatre Company was given special permission to restore the original ending of the novel. The company first performed a stage adaptation of the novel in August 1944 under the UK title of the novel, with Christie credited as the dramatist.[52] It was the first performance in repertory theatre.[52] It was staged again in 1965.[53] There was an article in the Dundee Evening Register in August 1944 about it.And Then There Were None (2005): On 14 October 2005, a new version of the play, written by Kevin Elyot and directed by Steven Pimlott, opened at the Gielgud Theatre in London. For this version, Elyot returned to the original story in the novel, restoring the nihilism of the original.[54]Television\n[edit]Three British TV adaptations have been broadcast. The first two, which appeared under Christie's original title, were produced by the BBC in 1949[55] and by ITV in 1959.[56] The third aired on BBC One in December 2015 as And Then There Were None.[57]An American TV movie by Paul Bogart aired on NBC in 1959. In 2010, American animated TV series Family Guy adapted the story as \"And Then There Were Fewer\".[58]There have been many foreign-language TV adaptations:Other media\n[edit]The novel was the inspiration for several video games. For the Apple II, Online Systems released Mystery House in 1980. On the PC, The Adventure Company released Agatha Christie: And Then There Were None in 2005, the first in a series of PC games based on Christie novels. In February 2008, it was ported to the Wii console.[61]And Then There Were None was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation on 30 April 2009, adapted by François Rivière and illustrated by Frank Leclercq.In 2014 Peká Editorial released a board game based on the book, Diez Negritos (\"Ten Little Negroes\"), created by Judit Hurtado and Fernando Chavarría, and illustrated by Esperanza Peinado.[62]The 2014 live action comedy-crime and murder mystery TV web series Ten Little Roosters, produced by American company Rooster Teeth, is largely inspired by And Then There Were None.[63]^ From Zehn kleine Negerlein to Und dann gab's keines mehr[30][31]\n^ From Tien kleine negertjes to En toen waren er nog maar...[32]\n^ From Tio små negerpojkar to Och så var de bara en[33]\n^ From O Caso dos Dez Negrinhos to E Não Sobrou Nenhum[34]\n^ From Dziesięciu Murzynków to I nie było już nikogo[35]\n^ From Dix petits nègres to Ils étaient dix[36]\n^ From Tíz kicsi néger to Mert többen nincsenek [37]\n^ From On Küçük Zenci to On Kişiydiler[38]\n^ From Desať malých černoškov to A napokon nezostal už nik[39]^ \"British Library Item details\". primocat.bl.uk.

{"title":"Dream of the Red Chamber","author":"Cao Xueqin","published":18,"fiction":true,"plot":"In the novel's frame story, a sentient Stone, left over when the goddess Nüwa mended the heaven aeons ago, wants to enjoy the pleasures of the \"red dust\" (the mundane world). The Stone begs a Taoist priest and a Buddhist monk to take it with them to see the world. The Stone, along with a companion (in Cheng-Gao versions they are merged into the same character), is then given a chance to learn from human existence, and enters the mortal realm. In the Cheng-Gao versions, he is reborn as Jia Baoyu (\"Precious Jade\") – thus \"The Story of the Stone\".The novel provides a detailed, episodic record of life in the two branches of the wealthy, aristocratic Jia (賈) clan—the Rongguo House (榮國府) and the Ningguo House (寧國府)—who reside in large, adjacent family compounds in the capital. The capital, however, is not named, and the first chapter insists that the dynasty is indeterminate.[16] The ancestors of the two families were made Chinese nobility and given imperial titles, and as the novel begins the houses are two of the most illustrious families in the city. One of the Jia daughters is made a Royal Consort, and to suitably receive her, the family constructs the Daguanyuan, a lush landscaped garden, the setting for much of subsequent action. The novel describes the Jias' wealth and influence in great naturalistic detail, and charts the Jias' fall from the height of their prestige, following some thirty main characters and over four hundred minor ones.As the carefree adolescent male heir of the family, Baoyu in this life has a special bond with his sickly cousin Lin Daiyu, who shares his love of music and poetry. Baoyu, however, is predestined to marry another cousin, Xue Baochai, whose grace and intelligence exemplify an ideal woman, but with whom he lacks an emotional connection. The romantic rivalry and friendship among the three characters against the backdrop of the family's declining fortunes form the central story.A series of paintings by Fei Danxu (1801–1850) depicting scenes from the novel:Dream of the Red Chamber contains an extraordinarily large number of characters: nearly 40 major characters, and over 400 additional ones.[17] The novel is known for complex portraits of its female characters.[18] According to Lu Xun in the appendix to A Brief History of Chinese Fiction, Dream of the Red Chamber broke every conceivable thought and technique in traditional Chinese fiction; its realistic characterization presents thoroughly human characters who are neither \"wholly good nor wholly bad\", but who seem to inhabit part of the real world.[19]The names of the characters in particular present a challenge to translators, since many of them convey meaning. David Hawkes left the names of the masters, mistresses, and their family members in pinyin (Jia Zheng and Lady Wang, for instance), translated the meanings of the servants' names, (such as Aroma and Skybright), put the names of the Daoists and Buddhists into Latin (Sapientia), and those of actors and actresses into French.[20]Jia Baoyu and the Twelve Beauties of Jinling\n[edit]\nThe Twelve Beauties of JinlingPortraits of the main female characters of the novel Dream of the Red Chamber, as they are known as the Twelve Beauties of Jinling, by an anonymous artist of the Qing dynasty, collection of the Posner Center of Carnegie Mellon University.Other main characters\n[edit]Notable minor characters\n[edit]The opening chapter of the novel describes a great stone archway and on either side a couplet is inscribed:This couplet is later reiterated, however this time as:As one critic points out, the couplet signifies \"not a hard and fast division between truth and falsity, reality and illusion, but the impossibility of making such distinctions in any world, fictional or actual.\"[27] It also symbolizes the peculiar Taoist religious tradition prevalent in Northern China since the Yuan dynasty as practiced in Cao's time, as well as Taoism's alternate roles in society such as doctrines for philosophical and intellectual rather than religious guidance and one of the schools of thought Buddhist sects in China syncretized with their own.[28] This theme is further reflected in the name of the main family, Jia (賈, pronounced jiǎ), which is a homophone with the character jiǎ 假, meaning false or fictitious; this is mirrored the surname of the other main family, Zhen (甄, pronounced zhēn), a homophone for the word \"real\" (真). It is suggested that the novel is both a realistic reflection and a fictional or \"dream\" version of Cao's own family.Early Chinese critics identified its two major themes as those of the nature of love, and of the transitoriness of earthly material values, as outlined in Buddhist and Taoist philosophies.[29] Later scholars echoed the philosophical aspects of love and its transcendent power as depicted in the novel.[30] One remarked that the novel is a remarkable example of the \"dialectic of dream and reality, art and life, passion and enlightenment, nostalgia and knowledge.\"[31]The novel also vividly depicts Chinese material culture, such as medicine, cuisine, tea culture, festivities, proverbs, mythology, Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, filial piety, opera, music, architecture, funeral rites, painting, classic literature and the Four Books. Among these, the novel is particularly notable for its grand use of poetry.[32]Since the establishment of Cao Xueqin as the novel's author, its autobiographical aspects have come to the fore. Cao Xueqin's clan was similarly raided in real life, and suffered a steep decline. Marxist interpretation starting in the New Culture Movement saw the novel as exposing feudal society's corruption and emphasized the clashes between the classes. Since the 1980s, critics have embraced the novel's richness and aesthetics in a more multicultural context.[33]In the title Hóng lóu Mèng (紅樓夢, literally \"Red Chamber Dream\"), \"red chamber\" can refer to the sheltered chambers where the daughters of a prominent family reside.[34] It also refers to Baoyu's dream in chapter five, set in a \"red chamber\", a dream where the fates of many of the characters are foreshadowed. \"Mansion\" is one of the definitions of the Chinese character \"樓\" (lóu), but the scholar Zhou Ruchang writes that in the phrase hónglóu it is more accurately translated as \"chamber\".[35]The novel's mythological elements were also inspired by the services Cao was involved in at the Dongyue Temple.[28] The temple's most venerated gods came from Daoism, Chinese Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism and shamanic traditions from various regions within and outside of China, and the book's spiritual themes, prose stylization, and portrayals of mythical figures were inspired by the traditional stories told about these deities and other oral temple traditions from Beijing.[28] Much of this folklore was already popular during the Yuan dynasty and was retold in various ways in Cao's era in the Qing dynasty.[28]In the late 19th century, Hong Lou Meng's influence was so pervasive that the reformer Liang Qichao attacked it along with another classic novel, Water Margin, as \"incitement to robbery and lust\", and for smothering the introduction of Western style novels, which he regarded as more socially responsible.[36] The eminent scholar Wang Guowei, however, achieved a new method of literary interpretation in an innovative and path-breaking 1904 essay which invoked the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. Wang called the novel \"the tragedy of tragedies\", in contrast to the prosperous endings in most earlier drama and fiction.[37] Wang further proclaims the novel as \"worthy of being considered as the one great masterpiece in the realm of Chinese art.\"[38]In the early 20th century, although the New Culture Movement took a critical view of the Confucian classics, the scholar Hu Shih used the tools of textual criticism to put the novel in an entirely different light, as a foundation for national culture. Hu and his students, Gu Jiegang and Yu Pingbo, first established that Cao Xueqin was the work's author. Taking the question of authorship seriously reflected a new respect for fiction, since the lesser forms of literature had not been traditionally ascribed to particular individuals.[39] Hu next built on Cai Yuanpei's investigations of the printing history of the early editions to prepare reliable reading texts. The final, and in some respects most important task, was to study the vocabulary and usage of Cao's Beijing dialect as a basis for Modern Mandarin.In the 1920s, scholars and devoted readers developed Hongxue, or Redology into both a scholarly field and a popular avocation. Among the avid readers was the young Mao Zedong, who later claimed to have read the novel five times and praised it as one of China's greatest works of literature.[40] The influence of the novel's themes and style are evident in many modern Chinese prose works. The early 1950s was a rich period for Redology with publication of major studies by Yu Pingbo. Zhou Ruchang, who as a young scholar had come to the attention of Hu Shih in the late 1940s, published his first study in 1953, which became a best seller.[41] But in 1954 Mao personally criticized Yu Pingbo for his \"bourgeois idealism\" in failing to emphasize that the novel exposed the decadence of \"feudal\" society and the theme of class struggle. In the Hundred Flowers Campaign, Yu came under heavy criticism but the attacks were so extensive and full of quotations from his work that they spread Yu's ideas to many people who would not otherwise have known of their existence.[42]During the Cultural Revolution, the novel initially came under fire, though it quickly regained its prestige in the following years. Zhou Ruchang resumed his lifework, eventually publishing more than sixty biographical and critical studies.[41] In 2006, Zhou, who had long distrusted Gao E's editions, and the novelist Liu Xinwu, author of popular studies of the novel, joined to produce a new 80 chapter version which Zhou had edited to eliminate the Cheng-Gao emendations. Liu completed an ending that was supposedly more true to Cao's original intent.[43] The novel continues to be influential on contemporary Chinese poets such as Middle Generation's An Qi, who paid homage to it in her poem To Cao Xueqin.[44]Cao utilizes many levels of colloquial and literary language and incorporates forms of classic poetry that are integral to the novel, making it a major challenge to translate.[46] A 2014 study of fourteen translations of the novel concluded that the work is a \"challenge even to the most resourceful of translators, and the process of rendering it into another language is bound to involve more translation problems, techniques, and principles than the process of rendering any other literary work.\" Accordingly, the aims and achievements of the translators differ widely.[47]The first recorded translation into English was in 1812 by the Protestant missionary and sinologist Robert Morrison (1782–1834), who translated part of chapter four for the second volume of his unpublished 1812 book Horae Sinicae. In 1816, Morrison did publish a translation of a conversation from chapter 31 in his Chinese language textbook Dialogues and Detached Sentences in the Chinese Language. In 1819, the British diplomat and sinologist John Francis Davis (1795–1890) published a short excerpt in the London Journal Quarterly Review. Davis also published a poem from chapter 3 in the 1830 Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society.[48] In 1842, Karl Gützlaff's article, \"Hung Lau Mung, or Dreams in the Red Chamber\", in the sixth volume of the \"Chinese Repository\", included translation and criticism of some passages.A literal translation of selected passages was published for foreigners learning Chinese by the Presbyterian Mission Press of Ningbo in 1846.[49]Edward Charles Bowra of the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs published a translation of the first eight chapters in 1868[50] and H. Bencraft Joly of the first fifty-six chapters in 1892.[51] The Reverend E.J. Eitel reviewed Joly's translation and condemned the novel, saying that Chinese read it \"because of its wickedness.\" Herbert Giles, whom John Minford called \"one of the more free-thinking British consular officers,\" took a more favorable view in a twenty-five page synopsis in 1885 that Minford calls still a \"useful guide.\"[52] Giles further highlighted it in his A History of Chinese Literature in 1901.[53]In 1928, Elfrida Hudson published a short introduction to the novel titled \"An old, old story\".[54] An abridged translation by Wang Chi-Chen which emphasized the central love story was published in 1929, with a preface by Arthur Waley. Waley said that \"we feel most clearly the symbolic or universal value\" of the characters in the passages which recount dreams. \"Pao Yu\", Waley continued, stands for \"imagination and poetry\" and his father for \"all those sordid powers of pedantry and restriction which hamper the artist\".[55] In a 1930 review of Wang's translation, Harry Clemons of The Virginia Quarterly Review wrote \"This is a great novel\", and along with the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, it \"ranks foremost\" among the novels of classic Chinese literature.[56] Although Clemons felt \"meaning was only fragmentarily revealed\" in the English translated prose and that \"many of the incidents\" and \"much of the poetry\" were omitted, he nevertheless thought \"at any rate the effort to read The Dream of the Red Chamber is eminently worth making.\"[56] In 1958 Wang published an expansion on his earlier abridgement, though it was still truncated at 60 chapters.The stream of translations and literary studies in the West grew steadily, building on Chinese language scholarship. The 1932 German translation by Franz Kuhn[57] was the basis of an abridged version, The Dream of the Red Chamber, by Florence and Isabel McHugh published in 1958,[58] and a later French version. Critic Anthony West wrote in The New Yorker in 1958 that the novel is to the Chinese \"very much what The Brothers Karamazov is to Russian and Remembrance of Things Past is to French literature\" and \"it is beyond question one of the great novels of all literature.\"[45]Kenneth Rexroth in a 1958 review of the McHugh translation, describes the novel as among the \"greatest works of prose fiction in all the history of literature\", for it is \"profoundly humane\".[59] Bramwell Seaton Bonsall finished what is probably the first complete 120 chapter translation in the 1950s, Red Chamber Dream, but publication was abandoned when Penguin announced the Hawkes project. A typescript is available on the web.[60]The respected and prolific Yang Hsien-yi was commissioned to translate the first complete English version. Though he confessed that this was his least favorite of the classic novels, Yang began work in 1961 and had finished roughly 100 chapters in 1964, when he was ordered to stop. He and his wife, Gladys Yang, were imprisoned on suspicion of espionage during the Cultural Revolution, but they finished the translation as a team after their release in 1974. It was published by Beijing Foreign Language Press as A Dream of Red Mansions, in three volumes, 1978–1980.[61] The second complete English translation to be published was by David Hawkes some century and a half after the first English translation. Hawkes was already a recognised redologist and had previously translated Chu Ci when Penguin Classics approached him in 1970 to make a translation which could appeal to English readers. After resigning from his professorial position, Hawkes published the first eighty chapters in three volumes (1973, 1977, 1980).[62]The Story of the Stone (1973–1980), the first eighty chapters translated by Hawkes and last forty by his son-in-law John Minford consists of five volumes and 2,339 pages of actual core text (not including Prefaces, Introductions and Appendices) and over 2,800 pages in total.[63] The word count of the Penguin Classics English translation is estimated at 845,000 words. In a 1980 review of the Hawkes and Minford translation in The New York Review of Books, Frederic Wakeman, Jr. described the novel as a \"masterpiece\" and the work of a \"literary genius\".[64] Cynthia L. Chennault of the University of Florida stated that \"The Dream is acclaimed as one of the most psychologically penetrating novels of world literature.\"[65] The novel and its author have been described as among the most significant works of literature and literary figures of the past millennium.[66][67]The sinologist Oldřich Král also undertook a Czech translation of the entire novel, Sen v červeném domě (Prague: Odeon, three volumes, 1986–1988). Slovak sinologist and philosopher Marina Čarnogurská translated into Slovak whole four volumes of the novel, Sen o Červenom pavilóne (Bratislava: Petrus, 2001–2003. .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}ISBN 80-88939-25-9).In 2014, an abridged English translation of Dream by writer Lin Yutang resurfaced in a Japanese library. Lin's translation, about half the length of the original, is reportedly not a literal one.[68]In a study of fourteen translations into English, German, French, Spanish, Laurence K. P. Wong finds that some challenges to translation are \"surmountable\", some \"insurmountable,\" though translators sometimes hit on \"surprisingly happy versions that come very close to the original,\" Hawkes, however, normally came up with versions that are \"accurate, ingenious, and delightful\". Hawkes recreates the meanings and sounds of the original with \"remarkable precision, achieving much greater success than any one of his fellow translators in surmounting the limits of literary translation\".[69] Another scholar agreed that the Yang's translation is \"literal\" in the sense of rendering word for word, but argued that the Hawkes translation achieved what should be called a \"higher level of literalness: in the sense of \"text for text.\" That is, Hawkes tries to maintain the range and contrasting levels of usage of the original while the Yangs smooth out the language with a \"plain international English\" and add explanations in footnotes.[70]Other scholars examined particular aspects of the Yangs' translation and the Hawkes and Minford translation. The names of some characters sound like the words for their personality traits, and some names serve as allusions. Hawkes conveys the communicative function of the names rather than lexical equivalence; for example, Huo Qi is homonymous with \"the beginning of catastrophe\", and Hawkes makes the English name \"Calamity\". Hawkes sometimes uses Italian/Sanskrit terms when Western Christian culture lacks a term for a concept.[71] Gladys Yang and Yang Hsien-yi prefer literal translation, informing readers of names' meanings through annotations. Zhu Jian-chun argued that Hawkes’ choice to simply translate certain names that are puns makes the author's intentions clearer, and that the Yangs' choice of transliteration leaves the meaning more elusive, even if the transliterated names are more believable as character names. Zhu questioned the Yangs' translation of \"Dao Ren\" as \"reverend\".[71] According to Barry Lee Reynolds and Chao-Chih Liao, the Yangs' version contains more faithful translations of religious expressions but is also less readable to English language readers.[72] Xuxiang Suo argued, “Hawkes successfully conveyed the original textual information to foreign readers with smooth and beautiful English, but the loss of Chinese culture-loaded information is inevitable. Mr. Yang mostly adopted the way of literal translation, trying his best to keep the true and idiomatic Chinese style and national tint.\"[73]Owing to its immense popularity, numerous sequels and continuations to the novel have been published, even during the Qing era. There are currently more than thirty recorded sequels or continuations to the novel, including modern ones.[74] Modern (post-1949) continuations tend to follow after the eightieth chapter, and include those by Zhang Zhi,[75] Zhou Yuqing,[76] Hu Nan[77] and Liu Xinwu.[78]At least fourteen cinematic adaptations of the Dream of the Red Chamber have been made, including the 1944 film directed by Bu Wancang, the 1977 Shaw Brothers adaptation starring Sylvia Chang and Brigitte Lin, and the 1988 film directed by Xie Tieli (谢铁骊) and Zhao Yuan (赵元). This last film took two years to prepare and three years to shoot, and remains, at 735 minutes, the longest Chinese film ever made.[79]In 1981, Jiangsu Song and Dance Ensemble premiered a dance drama version of Dream of the Red Chamber. A reworked version was performed in 1982 in Beijing by China Opera and Dance Drama Theatre featuring lead dancer Chen Ailian.[80]At least ten television adaptations have been produced (excluding numerous Chinese opera adaptations), and they include the renowned 1987 television series, which is regarded by many within China as being a near-definitive adaptation of the novel. It was initially somewhat controversial as few Redologists believed a television adaptation could do the novel full justice. Producer and director Wang Fulin's decision in employing non-professional young actors was vindicated as the television series gained enormous popularity in China. The series' success owes much to composer Wang Liping (王立平). He set many of the novel's classical verses to music, taking as long as four years to deliberate and complete his compositions. Other television versions include a 1996 Taiwanese series and a 2010 version directed by Fifth Generation director Li Shaohong.Unlike the other great Chinese novels, particularly Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Journey to the West, the Dream of the Red Chamber has received little attention in the gaming world, with only two Chinese language visual novels having been released as of 2017. Hong Lou Meng and Hong Lou Meng: Lin Daiyu yu Bei Jingwang (红楼梦：林黛玉与北静王) were both released by Beijing Entertainment All Technology (北京娱乐通). The latter one was released on 8 January 2010, and it is an extended version of the first game, with the main heroines of the game fully voiced and additional CG+endings.An English-language opera based on the novel in two acts was composed by Chinese American composer Bright Sheng, with libretto by Sheng and David Henry Hwang. The three-hour opera had its world premiere on 10 September 2016, by the San Francisco Opera. For their 2020 album, Transience of Life, the American art-rock band Elysian Fields set several poems from the novel to music.In the 2023 video game Limbus Company created by South Korean studio Project Moon, character Hong Lu is based on Dream of the Red Chamber. He is one of the 12 playable Sinners in the game, and wields a guandao. His Canto's setting and the characters in it take many of the locations and character names from the novel.Citations\n[edit]^ \"About the Novel: Introduction\". Cliffsnotes.com.

In chapter 1, after a second perusal of the book, Voiding-the-Void Daoist (supposedly its first reader) concludes that \"its main theme is about love.\" \"Love\" is perhaps an inadequate rendering of qing, whose range of associations includes desire, affection, feelings, emotions, sentiments, sentience. It is also linked to subjective consciousness, imagination, aesthetic sensibility. Cao Xueqin idealizes qing and raises its transcendent dimension to an almost metaphysical level; in doing so he also emphasizes lyrical self-containment, the power of the mind to dream and imagine a world, and the conception of the romantic-aesthetic as an alternate sphere of existence.

{"title":"She: A History of Adventure","author":"H. Rider Haggard","published":1887,"fiction":true,"plot":"Horace Holly, a young Cambridge University professor, is visited by Vincey, a colleague who, convinced that he will soon die, charges him with the task of raising his young son, Leo. He gives Holly a locked iron box, with instructions that it is not to be opened until Leo's 25th birthday. Holly agrees. Vincey is found dead the next day, and Holly raises the boy as his own. When the box is opened they discover the ancient \"Sherd of Amenartas\". Holly, Leo, and their servant, Job, follow instructions on the Sherd and travel to eastern Africa. After surviving a shipwreck, they and their Arab captain, Mahomed, journey into the African interior where they are captured by the savage Amahagger people. The adventurers learn that the natives are ruled by a fearsome white queen who is worshipped as Hiya or \"She-who-must-be-obeyed\".Billali, chief of one of the Amahagger tribes, takes charge of the three men, introducing them to the ways of his people. One of the Amahagger maidens, Ustane, takes a liking to Leo and, by kissing him and embracing him publicly, weds him according to Amahagger custom. Leo, likewise, grows very fond of her.Billali leaves to report the white men's arrival to the queen. In his absence, some of the Amahagger become restless and seize Mahomed, intending to eat him as part of a ritual \"hot pot\". Holly shoots and kills several of the Amahagger, accidentally killing Mahomed in the process. Leo is gravely wounded in a struggle, and Ustane saves his life by throwing herself onto his prostrate body. Billali returns and declares that the three men are under the queen's protection. Ustane faithfully attends to Leo, but his condition worsens.The men are taken to the home of the queen near the ruins of the lost city of Kôr, a once mighty civilisation that predated the Egyptians. In a series of catacombs originally built as tombs, Holly is presented to the queen, a white sorceress named Ayesha whose beauty is so great that it enchants any man who beholds it. Ayesha, veiled and behind a partition, warns Holly that the power of her splendour arouses both desire and fear. When she shows herself, Holly is enraptured and prostrates himself before her. Ayesha reveals that she has learned the secret of immortality and that she possesses other supernatural powers including the ability to read the minds of others, as well as healing wounds and curing illness, but she is unable to see into the future. She tells Holly that she has lived in Kôr for more than two millennia, awaiting the reincarnated return of her lover, Kallikrates (whom she had slain in a fit of jealous rage).The next evening Ayesha visits Leo, intending to heal him. But upon seeing his face she declares him to be the reincarnation of Kallikrates. Ayesha orders Ustane to leave and never set eyes on Leo again. When Ustane refuses, Ayesha strikes her dead with magic. Leo becomes bewitched, and despite the murder of Ustane, neither Holly nor Leo can free themselves from Ayesha's power. Ayesha shows Leo the perfectly preserved body of Kallikrates, which she has kept with her, and then dissolves the remains with a powerful acid, confident that Leo is indeed the reincarnation of her former lover.Ayesha takes the men to see the Pillar of Fire, passing through the ruins of Kôr into the heart of an ancient volcano. She is determined that Leo should bathe in the fire to become immortal and remain with her forever. Arriving at the great cavern, Leo doubts the safety of entering the fire. To allay his fears, Ayesha herself steps into the flame, but with this second immersion her life-preserving power is lost and she begins to wither and revert to her true age. The sight is so shocking that Job dies of fright. Before dying, Ayesha tells Leo, \"Forget me not. I shall come again!\" Holly and Leo then depart from Kôr and eventually return to their home in Cambridge.South Africa\n[edit]In 1875, Haggard was sent to Cape Town, South Africa as secretary to Sir Henry Bulwer, the lieutenant-governor of Natal. Haggard wrote in his memoirs of his aspirations to become a colonial governor himself, and of his youthful excitement at the prospects.[5] The major event during his time in Africa was Britain's annexation of the Transvaal in 1877. Haggard was part of the expedition that established British control over the Boer republic, and which helped raise the Union flag over the capital of Pretoria on 24 May 1877. Writing of the moment, Haggard declared:Haggard had advocated the British annexation of the Boer republic in a journal article entitled \"The Transvaal\", published in the May 1877 issue of Macmillan's Magazine. He maintained that it was Britain's \"mission to conquer and hold in subjection, not from thirst of conquest but for the sake of law, justice, and order\".[7] However, Boer resistance to annexation and the resulting Anglo-Zulu War caused the government in London to withdraw from pursuing sovereignty over the South African interior.[8] Haggard considered this to be a \"great betrayal\" by Prime Minister Gladstone and the Liberal Party, which \"no lapse of time ever can solace or even alleviate\".[9] He became increasingly disillusioned with the realities of colonial Africa. Victorian scholar Patrick Brantlinger notes in his introduction to She: \"Little that Haggard witnessed matched the romantic depictions of 'the dark continent' in boys' adventure novels, in the press, and even in such bestselling explorers' journals as David Livingstone's Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa (1857).\"[10]During his time in South Africa, Haggard developed an intense hatred for the Boers, but also came to admire the Zulus.[11] However, his admiration of the Zulus did not extend to other African peoples; rather, he shared many of the assumptions that underlay contemporary politics and philosophy,[12] such as those expressed by James Hunt, the President of the Anthropological Society of London: \"the Negro is inferior intellectually to the European...[and] can only be humanised and civilised by Europeans. The analogies are far more numerous between the Negro and apes, than between the European and apes.\"[13] The Victorian belief in the inherent inferiority of the 'darker races' made them the object of a civilising impulse in the European Scramble for Africa. Although disenchanted with the colonial effort, Haggard remained committed to this ideology. He believed that the British \"alone of all the nations in the world appear to be able to control coloured races without the exercise of cruelty\".[7]Return to Britain\n[edit]Rider Haggard returned to Britain in 1881. At the time, England was increasingly beset by the social and cultural anxieties that marked the fin de siècle.[14] One of the most prominent concerns was the fear of political and racial decline, encapsulated in Max Nordau's Degeneration (1895). Barely half a century earlier, Thomas Babington Macaulay had declared \"the history of England\" to be \"emphatically the history of progress\",[15] but late-Victorians living in the wake of Darwinian evolutionary theory had lost the earlier positivism of their age.[16] Uncertainty over the immutability of Britain's historical identity, what historian Tim Murray has called the \"threat of the past\", was manifested in the Victorian obsession with ancient times and archaeology.[17] Haggard was greatly interested in the ruins discovered at Zimbabwe in the 1870s. In 1896, he provided the preface to a monograph that detailed a history of the site, declaring:By the time that Haggard began writing She, society had more anxiety about the role of women. Debates regarding \"The Woman Question\" dominated Britain during the fin de siècle, as well as anxieties over the increasing position and independence of the \"New Woman\".[19] Alarm over social degeneration and societal decadence further fanned concerns over the women's movement and female liberation, which challenged the traditional conception of Victorian womanhood.[20] The role and rights of women had changed dramatically since the early part of the century, as they entered the workforce, received better education, and gained more political and legal independence. Writing in 1894, Haggard believed that marriage was the natural state for women: \"Notwithstanding the energetic repudiations of the fact that confront us at every turn, it may be taken for granted that in most cases it is the natural mission of women to marry; that – always in most cases – if they do not marry they become narrowed, live a half life only, and suffer in health of body and of mind.\"[21] He created the character of She-who-must-be-obeyed \"who provided a touchstone for many of the anxieties surrounding the New Woman in late-Victorian England\".[22]According to Haggard's daughter Lilias, the phrase \"She-who-must-be-obeyed\" originated from his childhood and \"the particularly hideous aspect\" of one rag-doll: \"This doll was something of a fetish, and Rider, as a small child, was terrified of her, a fact soon discovered by an unscrupulous nurse who made full use of it to frighten him into obedience. Why or how it came to be called She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed he could not remember.\"[23] Haggard wrote that \"the title She\" was taken \"from a certain rag doll, so named, which a nurse at Bradenham used to bring out of some dark recess in order to terrify those of my brothers and sisters who were in her charge.\"[24]In his autobiography, Haggard writes of how he composed She in six weeks in February and March 1886, having just completed Jess, which was published in 1887. Haggard claimed that this was an intensely creative period: the text \"was never rewritten, and the manuscript carries but few corrections\". Haggard went on to declare: \"The fact is that it was written at white heat, almost without rest, and that is the best way to compose.\" He admitted to having had no clear story in mind when he began writing:Various scholars have detected a number of analogues to She in earlier literature. According to Brantlinger, Haggard certainly read the stories of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, in particular A Strange Story (1862), which includes a mysterious veiled woman called \"Ayesha\", and The Coming Race (1871), which is about the discovery of a subterranean civilisation.[25] Similarly, the name of the underground civilisation in She, known as Kôr, is derived from Norse mythological romance, where the deathbed of the goddess Hel is called Kör, which means \"disease\" in Old Norse.[26] In She, a plague destroyed the original inhabitants of Kôr.According to Haggard, he wrote the final scene of Ayesha's demise while waiting for his literary agent, A. P. Watt, to return to his office. Once he had completed it he entered Watt's office and threw the manuscript \"on the table, with the remark: 'There is what I shall be remembered by'\".[27]Various traditions of female monarchy on the African continent were also precursors. A reference to one such influence on She appears in Lieutenant George Witton's 1907 book Scapegoats of the Empire; The True Story of the Bushveldt Carbineers:Publication\n[edit]She was first published as a serial story in The Graphic, a large folio magazine printed weekly in London, between October 1886 and January 1887. The serialisation was accompanied with illustrations by E. K. Johnson. An American edition was published by Harper & Bros. in New York on 24 December 1886; this included Johnson's illustrations. On 1 January 1887 a British edition was published by Longmans, Green, & Co., without any illustrations. It featured significant textual revisions by Haggard.[30] He made further revisions for the British edition of 1888, which included new illustrations by Maurice Greiffenhagen and C. H. M. Kerr. In 2006 Broadview published the first edition of She since 1887 to reproduce the Graphic serial text.[31]Narrative revisions\n[edit]Haggard contended that romances such as She or King Solomon's Mines were best left unrevised because \"wine of this character loses its bouquet when it is poured from glass to glass\".[32] However, he made a number of alterations to the Graphic version of She before its publication as a novel in 1887. One of the most significant was to the third chapter concerning the sherd, which was substantially expanded from the original to include the tale of Amenartas in uncial and cursive Greek scripts. Facsimile illustrations were also included of an antique vase, made up by Haggard's sister-in-law Agnes Barber to resemble the sherd of Amenartas. A number of footnotes were also included containing historical references by the narrator. Haggard was keen to stress the historicity of the narrative, improving some of the information about geography and about ancient civilisations in Chapters 4, 13, and 17.[33]The 1887 edition of the novel also features a substantially rewritten version of the \"hotpot\" scene in Chapter 8, when Mahomed is killed. In the original serialisation the cannibal Amahagger grow restless and hungry, and place a large heated pot over Mahomed's head, enacting the hotpotting ritual before eating him. Haggard's stories were criticised at the time for their violence, and he toned this scene down, so that Mahomed dies when Holly shoots him accidentally in the scuffle with the Amahagger. Comparing the serial and novel editions of She, Stauffer describes the more compact narrative of the original as a reflection of the intense burst of creativity in which Haggard composed the story, arguing that \"the style and grammar of the Graphic [edition] is more energetic and immediate\", although, as he noted, it is also \"sometimes more flawed\".[34]Haggard continued to revise She for later editions. The \"New Edition\" of 1888 contains more than 400 minor alterations. The last revision by Haggard was in 1896.[33]Fantasy and science fiction\n[edit]She is one of the foundational works of fantasy literature, coming around the time of The Princess and the Goblin (1858) by George MacDonald, William Morris' The Wood Beyond the World and The Well at the World's End, and the short stories of Lord Dunsany.[35] It is marked by a strong element of \"the marvelous\" in the figure of Ayesha, a two-thousand-year-old sorceress, and the 'Spirit of the World', an undying fire that confers immortality.[36] Indeed, Haggard's story is one of the first in modern literature to feature \"a slight intrusion of something unreal\" into a very real world – a hallmark of the fantasy genre.[37] Similarly, the carefully constructed \"fantasy history\" of She foreshadows the use of this technique that characterises later fantasies such as The Lord of the Rings and The Wheel of Time series, and which imparts a \"degree of security\" to the secondary world.[38] However, the story of She is firmly ensconced in what fantasy theorists call 'primary world reality', with the lost kingdom of Kôr, the realm ruled by the supernatural She, a fantastic \"Tertiary World\" at once directly part of and at the same time indirectly set apart from normative \"primary\" reality.[39] Along with Haggard's prior novel, King Solomon's Mines, She laid the blueprints for the \"lost world\" subgenre in fantasy literature, as well as the convention of the \"lost race\".[40] As Brantlinger has noted of the novel's importance to the development of the \"secondary world\" in fantasy literature: \"Haggard may seem peripheral to the development of science fiction, and yet his African quest romances could easily be transposed to other planets and galaxies\".[25] In his history of science fiction, Billion Year Spree, Brian Aldiss notes the frequency with which Ayesha's death in the Pillar of Fire has been imitated by later science fiction and fantasy writers: \"From Haggard on, crumbling women, priestesses, or empresses – all symbols of women as Untouchable and Unmakeable – fill the pages of many a scientific romance\".[41]Adventure romance\n[edit]She is part of the adventure subgenre of literature which was especially popular at the end of the 19th century, but which remains an important form of fiction to the present day. Along with works such as Treasure Island (1883) and Prince Otto (1885) by Robert Louis Stevenson, and Jules Verne's A Journey to the Center of the Earth (1871) and Around the World in Eighty Days (1875), She had an important formative effect on the development of the adventure novel. Indeed, Rider Haggard is credited with inventing the romance of archaeological exploration which began in King Solomon's Mines and crystallised in She. One of the most notable modern forms of this genre is the Indiana Jones movie series, as well as the Tarzan novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and Alan Moore's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2000).[42] In such fictional narratives, the explorer is the hero, with the drama unfolding as they are cast into \"the nostrum of the living past\".[43] Holly and Leo are prototypes of the adventurer, who has become a critical figure in modern fiction.Imperial Gothic\n[edit]She is also one of the central texts in the development of Imperial Gothic. Many late-Victorian authors during the fin de siècle employed Gothic conventions and motifs in their writing, stressing and alluding to the supernatural, the ghostly, and the demonic.[44] As Brantlinger has noted, \"Connected to imperialist adventure fiction, these interests often imply anxieties about the stability of Britain, of the British Empire, or, more generally, of Western civilisation\".[45] Novels like Dracula and Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde present depictions of repressed, foreign, and demonic forces at the heart of the imperial polity. In She the danger is raised in the form of Ayesha herself:She's threat to replace Queen Victoria with herself echoes the underlying anxiety over European colonialism emblematic of the Imperial Gothic genre.[47] Indeed, Judith Wilt characterises the narrative of She, in which the penetration into Africa (represented by Holly, Leo, and Job) suddenly suffers a potential \"counter-attack\" (from Ayesha), as one of the archetypal illustrations of the \"reverse colonialism\" motif in Victorian Gothic.[48] Similarly, She marks one of the first fictional examples to raise the spectre of the natural decline of civilisation, and by extension, British imperial power, which would become an increasingly frequent theme in Gothic and invasion literature until the onset of World War I.[49]Rider Haggard's writing style was much criticised in reviews of She and his other works. His harshest critic was Augustus Moore, who wrote: \"God help English literature when English people lay aside their Waverley novels, and the works of Defoe, Swift, Thackeray, Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot, and even Charles Reade, for the penny dreadfuls of Mr Haggard.\" He added: \"The man who could write 'he spoke to She' can have no ear at all.\"[50] A more common sentiment was expressed in the anonymous review of She in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine: \"Mr Rider Haggard is not an exquisite workman like Mr [Robert Louis] Stevenson, but he has a great deal of power in his way, and rougher qualities which are more likely, perhaps, to 'take the town' than skill more delicate.\"[51]Modern literary criticism has tended to be more circumspect. As Daniel Karlin has noted, \"That Haggard's style is frequently bathetic or clumsy cannot be denied; but the matter is not so easily settled.\"[52] Stauffer cites the passage in which Holly meditates as he tries to fall asleep as emblematic of \"the charges against\" Haggard's writing.[53] In this scene Holly lies down andThe passage concludes with a wry remark from Holly: \"I at last managed to get to sleep, a fact for which anybody who reads this narrative, if anybody ever does, may very probably be thankful.\"[55] According to Stauffer, \"the disarming deflation of the passage goes a long way toward redeeming it, and is typical of the winning contradictions of the narrator's style\".[56] Tom Pocock in Rider Haggard and the Lost Empire has also highlighted the \"literary framework\" that Haggard constructs throughout much of the narrative, referencing Keats, Shakespeare and Classical literature to imbue the story with a \"Gothic sensibility\".[57] Yet as Stauffer notes, \"Ultimately, however, one thinks of Haggard's plots, episodes, and images as the source of his lasting reputation and influence.\"[56]Imperialism\n[edit]She is set firmly in the imperialist literature of the late-Victorian period. The so-called \"New Imperialism\" marking the last quarter of the 19th century witnessed a further expansion of European colonies, particularly on the African continent, and was characterised by a seeming confidence in the merits of empire and European civilisation.[58] Thus She \"invokes a particularly British view of the world\" as Rider Haggard projects concepts of the English self against the foreign otherness of Africa.[59] One example occurs when Holly is first ushered into the presence of Ayesha, walking into the chamber behind a grovelling Billali who warns Holly to follow his example, or \"a surety she will blast thee where thou standest\". She stresses quintessential British qualities through the \"adventure\" of empire, usually in contrast to foreign barbarism.[60] The notion of imperialism is further compounded by the figure of She, who is herself a foreign colonising force. \"In a sense then\", Stauffer writes, \"a single property line divides the realm of Queen Victoria and that of She-who-must-be-obeyed, two white queens who rule dark-skinned natives of the African continent.\"[61]Race and evolution\n[edit]Like many of his Victorian contemporaries, Rider Haggard proceeded \"on the assumption that whites are naturally superior to blacks, and that Britain's imperial extensions into Africa [were] a noble, civilising enterprise\".[62] Although Haggard wrote a number of novels that portray Africans in a comparatively realistic light, She is not among their number. Even in King Solomon's Mines, the representation of Umbopa (who was based on an actual warrior) and the Kukuanas drew upon Haggard's knowledge and understanding of the Zulus.[63] In contrast, She makes no such distinctions. Ayesha, the English travellers and the ancient inhabitants of Kôr are all white embodiments of civilisation, while the darker Amahagger, as a people, illustrate notions of savagery, barbarity and superstition. Nonetheless, the \"racial politics of the novel are more complex than they first appear\", given that Ayesha is in origin an ancient Arabian; Leo is descended from, and physically resembles, a blond Hellenistic Greek; and Holly is said to resemble a baboon, an animal that Victorians typically associated with black Africans.[61] Critics such as Wendy Katz, Patricia Murphy and Susan Gubar have discussed what they perceive as a strong racist undercurrent in She,[64][65] but Andrew M. Stauffer takes note of the ways in which \"the novel suggests deeper connections among the races, an ancient genealogy of ethnicities and civilizations in which every character is a hybrid\".[61]There is a strong Social Darwinian pseudo-scientific undercurrent framing the representation of race in She, stemming from Haggard's own interests in evolutionary theory and archaeology.[66] In particular, the theme of racial degeneration appears in the novel. Moving into the fin de siècle, late Victorians were increasingly concerned about cultural and national decline resulting from racial decay.[67] In She, this evolutionary concept of degeneration through miscegenation is manifested in Ayesha and the Amahagger. Haggard represents the Amahagger as a debased mixture of ethnicities, \"a curious mingling of races\", originally descended from the inhabitants of Kôr but intermarried with Arabs and Africans.[68] Racial hybridisation of any kind \"entailed degeneration\" to Victorians, a \"decline from the pure blood\" of the initial races, and thus \"an aspect of their degeneration is the idea that the Amahagger have lost whatever elements of civilization their Kôr ancestors may have imparted to them\".[69] Ayesha proudly proclaims her own racial purity as a quality to be admired: \"for Arabian am I by birth, even 'al Arab al Ariba' (an Arab of the Arabs), and of the race of our father Yárab, the son of Khâtan ... of the true Arab blood\".[70] However, Judith Wilt has argued that the novel's starkest evocation of the evolutionary principle occurs in the regressive demise of Ayesha. Stepping into the Pillar of Fire, the immortal She begins to wither and decay, undergoing what Wilt describes as the \"ultimate Darwinian nightmare\": evolution in reverse.[71]Female authority and sexuality\n[edit]When Rider Haggard first conceived of She he began with the theme of \"an immortal woman inspired by an immortal love\".[72] Although ostensibly a romance, the novel is part of the wider discourse regarding women and womanhood in late-Victorian Britain. Many scholars have noted how She was published as a book in 1887, the year of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, and Adrienne Munich argues that Haggard's story \"could fittingly be considered an ominous literary monument to Victoria after fifty years of her reign\".[73] Indeed, in her devotion to Kallikrates (two thousand years after his death), Ayesha echoes the long-lasting fidelity of Victoria to her husband, Albert. However, unlike the \"benign\" Victoria, the question of female authority is realised to the extreme in the figure of She-who-must-be-obeyed, whose autonomous will seemingly embodies Victorian anti-feminist fears of New Women desiring 'absolute personal independence coupled with supreme power over men'.[74] Haggard constantly emphasises this anxiety over female authority in She, so that even the rationally minded and misogynistic Holly, who has put his \"heart away from such vanity as woman's loveliness\", ultimately falls upon his knees and worships Ayesha \"as never woman was worshipped\".[75] Similarly, although the masculine and chivalric Leo is determined to reject Ayesha for killing the devoted native girl Ustane, he too quickly falls under her will.[76]In her role as the seductive femme fatale, Ayesha is part of \"a long tradition of male fantasy that includes Homer's Circe, Shakespeare's Cleopatra, and Keats's 'La Belle Dame sans Merci'\".[77] Brantlinger identifies the theme of \"the white (or at least light-skinned) queen ruling a black or brown-skinned savage race\" as \"a powerfully erotic one\" with its opposite being \"the image of the helpless white woman captured by savages and threatened, at least, with rape\".[78] The figure of She both inspires male desire and dominates male sovereignty, represented in her conquest of the 'enlightened' Victorians Holly and Leo. The two Englishmen embody the powers of manhood, with Leo a reflection of masculine physicality and Holly a representation of man's intellectual strength, but both are conquered by the feminine powers of She, who rules as much through sex-appeal as through sorcery, immortality, and will. Thus, Steven Arata describes her as \"the veiled woman, that ubiquitous nineteenth-century figure of male desire and anxiety, whose body is Truth but a Truth that blasts\".[79] Similarly, Sarah Gilbert sees the theme of feminine sexuality and authority realised in Ayesha as critical to the novel's success: \"Unlike the women earlier Victorian writers had idealised or excoriated, She was neither an angel nor a monster. Rather, She was an odd but significant blend of the two types – an angelically chaste woman with monstrous powers, a monstrously passionate woman with angelic charms\".[80]After its publication in 1887 She became an immediate success. According to The Literary World \"Mr. Rider Haggard has made for himself a new field in fiction\". Comparing the novel to King Solomon's Mines the review declared: \"The book before us displays all the same qualities, and we anticipate for it a similar popularity. There is even more imagination in the later than in the earlier story; it contains scenes of greater sensuous beauty and also of more gruesome horror\".[81] The Public Opinion was equally rapturous in its praise:The fantasy of She received particular acclaim from Victorian readers and critics. The review appearing in The Academy on 15 January was impressed by the \"grown-up\" vision of the novel, declaring \"the more impossible it gets the better Mr. Haggard does it... his astonishing imagination, and a certain vraisemblance [\"verisimilitude\" (French)] makes the most impossible adventures appear true\".[83] This sentiment was echoed in The Queen: The Lady's Newspaper, with the reviewer pronouncing that \"this is a tale in the hands of a writer not so able as Mr. Haggard might easily have become absurd; but he has treated it with so much vividness and picturesque power as to invest it with unflagging interest, and given to the mystery a port of philosophic possibility that makes us quite willing to submit to the illusion.[84]I must write to congratulate you upon a work which most certainly puts you at the head – a long away ahead – of all contemporary imaginative writers. If fiction is best cultivated in the field of pure invention then you are certainly the first of modern novelists.\n\n– Sir Walter Besant[85]The Spectator was more equivocal in its appraisal of She. The review described the narrative as \"very stirring\" and \"exciting\" and of \"remarkable imaginative power\", adding: \"The ingenuity of the story... is as subtle as ever romancer invented, and from the day when Leo and Holly land on the coast of Africa, to the day when the Pillar of Fire is revealed to them by the all but immortal 'She-who-must-be-obeyed', the interest of the tale rises higher and higher with every new turn in its course\". However, the review took issue with the characterisation of She and the manner of her demise: \"To the present writer there is a sense of the ludicrous in the end of She that spoiled, instead of concluding with imaginative fitness, the thread of the impossible worked into the substance of this vivid and brilliantly told story\".[86] Haggard was moved to respond to the criticism of Ayesha's death, writing that \"in the insolence of her strength and loveliness, she lifts herself up against the Omnipotent. Therefore, at the appointed time she is swept away by It... Vengeance, more heavy because more long delayed, strikes her in her proudest part – her beauty\".[87]A number of reviews were more critical of Haggard's work. Although the reviewer of She in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine considered it better than King Solomon's Mines, he opined, \"Mr. Rider Haggard has not proved as yet that he has anything that can be called imagination at all... It might be wrought up into an unparalleled stage effect: but it is rather a failure in pen and ink. The more fearful and wonderful such circumstances are intended to be, the more absurd is the failure of them\".[88] Even more scathing was Augustus Moore in the May edition of Time: A Monthly Miscellany, who declared: \"In Mr Haggard's book I find none of the powerful imagination, the elaborate detail, the vivid English which would entitle his work to be described as a romance... [rather] it seems to me to be the method of the modern melodrama\". Moore was particularly dismissive of the novel's style and prose: \"Mr Haggard cannot write English at all. I do not merely refer to his bad grammar, which a boy at a Boarding School would deserve to be birched for... It can only have been written by a man who not only knew nothing, but cared nothing for 'English undefiled'.\" Haggard's English was a common source of criticisms, but Moore was even dismissive of the character of She, who was highly regarded by many other critics. \"Ayesha\", Moore declares, \"is about as impressive as the singing chambermaid who represents the naughty fairy of a pantomime in tights and a tow wig\". Concluding his review, Moore wondered at the success that had greeted She:Despite such criticism, the reception that met She was overwhelmingly positive and echoed the sentiments expressed by anthropologist and literary critic Andrew Lang before the story's first publication: \"I think She is one of the most astonishing romances I ever read. The more impossible it is, the better you do it, till it seems like a story from the literature of another planet\".[90]The book Science-Fiction: The Early Years stated that She was \"one of the great classics of fantastic fiction\" and \"as vital now as when it was first printed\".[91]In his essay Supernatural Horror in Literature (1927), H.P. Lovecraft called She a 'really remarkably good' book and wrote that Haggard was continuing a 'romantic, semi-Gothic, quasi-moral tradition' first seen in the works of Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton.Feminist literary historians have tended to define the figure of She as a literary manifestation of male alarm over the \"learned and crusading new woman\".[92] In this view, Ayesha is a terrifying and dominant figure, a prominent and influential rendering of the misogynistic \"fictive explorations of female authority\" undertaken by male writers that ushered in literary modernism.[93] Ann Ardis, for instance, views the fears Holly harbours over Ayesha's plan to return to England as being \"exactly those voiced about the New Woman's entrance in the public arena\".[94] According to the feminist interpretation of the narrative, the death of She acts as a kind of teleological \"judgement\" of her transgression of Victorian gender boundaries,[93] with Ardis likening it to a \"witch-burning\". However, to Rider Haggard, She was an investigation into love and immortality and the demise of Ayesha the moral end of this exploration:Indeed, far from being a radical or threatening manifestation of womanhood, recent academics have noted the extent to which the character of She conforms to traditional conceptions of Victorian femininity;[96] in particular her deferring devotion to Kallikrates/Leo, whom she swears wifely obedience to at the story's climax: \"'Behold!' and she took his [Leo's] hand and placed it upon her shapely head, and then bent herself slowly down till one knee for an instant touched the ground – 'Behold! in token of submission do I bow me to my lord! Behold!' and she kissed him on the lips, 'in token of my wifely love do I kiss my lord'.\" Ayesha declares this to be the \"first most holy hour of completed womanhood\".[97]She is one of the most influential novels in modern literature. Several authors, including Rudyard Kipling, Henry Miller, Graham Greene, J.R.R. Tolkien and Margaret Atwood, have acknowledged its importance to their own and others' writing.[56] With more than 83 million copies sold, the novel is one of the best-selling fictional works of all time and has been translated into 44 languages.[98] According to Stauffer, \"She has always been Rider Haggard's most popular and influential novel, challenged only by King Solomon's Mines in this regard\".[99] The novel is cited in the psychoanalytical theories of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, the latter describing the character of She as a manifestation of the anima figure.[100][101]The novel has had a lasting impact on the fantasy genre in particular,[102] directly giving rise to the \"lost civilisation\" tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and the creation of mythologised locations such as Shangri-la. Tolkien recognised the importance of She to his own fantasy works, especially in its foregrounding of a fictional history and narrative.[103] Some scholars have also argued that She may have had a formative influence on Galadriel in The Lord of the Rings: Ayesha's reflecting pool seems to be a direct precursor of Galadriel's mirror. Other characters in Tolkien's Legendarium also seem to have been influenced, including Shelob (who is referred to as \"She\" and \"Her\" in the text), and the escape of the Fellowship of the Ring across the chasm in Moria may be reminiscent of the escape across the chasm near the end of She.[104][105] Similarly, the \"hot pot\" ritual of Haggard's Amahagger people appears to have been an inspiration or predecessor of the death of Viserys Targaryen in George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones; and Daenerys Targaryen, Cersei Lannister, and especially Melisandre of Asshai, priestess of the god R'hllor, might be seen as characters in the tradition beginning with Ayesha. Indeed, Haggard's characterisation of Ayesha became the prototype of the female antagonist in modern fantasy literature,[41] most famously realised in the figure of the White Witch, Jadis, in C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia.[106][107] Kor and Ayesha appear in Alan Moore's Nemo: Heart of Ice. The name Ayesha is used in Marvel comics for the female superheroine Ayesha, leader of the Sovereign race, also known as Kismet. Her portrayal in the film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 2017 as a beautiful, powerful yet ruthless and cold empress in a grand court recalls Haggard's characterisation of Ayesha.At the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 the H. Jay Smith Exploring Company presented an exhibit of artefacts from the American Southwest featuring objects and human remains of the Basketmaker and Cliff Dweller (Ancestral Puebloan) cultures. The exhibit featured a mummy that had been preserved naturally by the southwestern climate and that was given the name \"She\".[citation needed]Adaptations\n[edit]She has been adapted for the cinema at least eleven times, beginning with the 1899 short film The Pillar of Fire, directed by Georges Méliès,[108] followed by another short film directed by Edwin S. Porter in 1908. An American 1911 version starred Marguerite Snow, a British-produced version appeared in 1916, and in 1917 Valeska Suratt appeared in a production for Fox which is lost. In 1925 a silent film of She, starring Betty Blythe, was produced with the active participation of Rider Haggard, who wrote the intertitles. The film combines elements from all the books in the series.A decade later, another cinematic version of the novel was released, featuring Helen Gahagan, Randolph Scott and Nigel Bruce.[109] This 1935 adaptation was set in the Arctic, rather than Africa, and depicts the ancient civilisation of the story in an Art Deco style, with music by Max Steiner. in 1958 Roger Corman announced he would direct a film version in Australia but the film was not made.[110]The 1965 film She was produced by Hammer Film Productions, and starred Ursula Andress as Ayesha and John Richardson as her reincarnated love, with Peter Cushing as Holly, Christopher Lee as Billali and Bernard Cribbins as Job.[111]A post-apocalyptic film version of the same title, directed by Avi Nesher, was released in the United States in 1985.In 2001, another adaption was released direct to video with Ian Duncan as Leo Vincey, Ophélie Winter as Ayesha and Marie Bäumer as Roxane.Tim McInnerny starred as Holly (renamed Ludwig Holly) with Mia Soteriou as Ayesha and Oliver Chris as Leo in a two-part adaptation on BBC Radio 4's Classic Serial, originally broadcast on 2 July and 9 July 2006.[112]In 2007, a rock-opera/musical version of She was recorded live at the Wyspianski Theatre, Katowice, Poland by Clive Nolan and was released on DVD. In February 2012, the Nolan version of She had its first UK performance at the Playhouse in Cheltenham.[113]According to Financial Times reviewer James Lovegrove, Juliet E. McKenna's 2012 She-who-thinks-for-herself, is \"a cunning, funny... feminist rewrite\" of She.[114]Sequel and prequels\n[edit]Editions\n[edit]^ Carter, Lin, ed. (1976). Realms of Wizardry.

{"title":"The Da Vinci Code","author":"Dan Brown","published":2003,"fiction":true,"plot":"Louvre curator and Priory of Sion grand master Jacques Saunière is fatally shot one night at the museum by an albino Catholic monk named Silas, who is working on behalf of someone he knows only as the Teacher, who wishes to discover the location of the \"keystone\", an item crucial in the search for the Holy Grail. After Saunière's body is discovered in the pose of the Vitruvian Man by Leonardo da Vinci, the police summon Harvard professor Robert Langdon, who is in town on business. Police captain Bezu Fache tells him that he was summoned to help the police decode the cryptic message Saunière left during the final minutes of his life. The message includes a Fibonacci sequence out of order and an anagram: \"O, draconian devil! Oh, lame saint!\" Langdon explains to Fache that the pentacle Saunière drew on his chest in his own blood represents an allusion to the goddess and not devil worship, as Fache believes.Sophie Neveu, a police cryptographer, secretly explains to Langdon that she is Saunière's estranged granddaughter and that Fache thinks Langdon is the murderer because the last line in her grandfather's message, which was meant for Neveu, said \"P.S. Find Robert Langdon\", which Fache had erased prior to Langdon's arrival. However, \"P.S.\" does not refer to \"postscript\", but rather to Sophie — the nickname given to her by her grandfather was \"Princess Sophie\". She understands that her grandfather intended Langdon to decipher the code, which leads to Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, which in turn leads to his painting Madonna of the Rocks. They find a pendant that holds the address of the Paris branch of the Depository Bank of Zurich.Neveu and Langdon escape from the police and visit the bank. In the safe deposit box, which is unlocked with the Fibonacci sequence, they find a box containing the keystone: a cryptex, a cylindrical, hand-held vault with five concentric, rotating dials labeled with letters. When they are lined up correctly, they unlock the device, but if the cryptex is forced open, an enclosed vial of vinegar breaks and dissolves the message inside the cryptex, which was written on papyrus. The box containing the cryptex contains clues to its password.Langdon and Neveu take the keystone to the home of Langdon's friend, Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on the Holy Grail, the legend of which is heavily connected to the Priory. There, Teabing explains that the Grail is not a cup but connected to Mary Magdalene, and that she was Jesus Christ's wife and is the person to his right in The Last Supper. The trio then flee the country on Teabing's private plane, on which they conclude that the proper combination of letters spells out Neveu's given name, Sofia. Opening the cryptex, they discover a smaller cryptex inside it, along with another riddle that ultimately leads the group to the tomb of Isaac Newton in Westminster Abbey.During the flight to Britain, Neveu reveals the source of her estrangement from her grandfather ten years earlier: arriving home unexpectedly from university, Neveu secretly witnessed a spring fertility rite conducted in the secret basement of her grandfather's country estate. From her hiding place, she was shocked to see her grandfather with a woman at the center of a ritual attended by men and women who were wearing masks and chanting praise to the goddess. She fled the house and broke off all contact with Saunière. Langdon explains that what she witnessed was an ancient ceremony known as hieros gamos or \"sacred marriage\".By the time they arrive at Westminster Abbey, Teabing is revealed to be the Teacher for whom Silas is working. Teabing wishes to use the Holy Grail, which he believes is a series of documents establishing that Jesus Christ married Mary Magdalene and fathered children, in order to ruin the Vatican. He compels Langdon at gunpoint to solve the second cryptex's password, which Langdon realizes is \"apple\". Langdon secretly opens the cryptex and removes its contents before tossing the empty cryptex in the air. Teabing is arrested by Fache, who by now realizes that Langdon is innocent. Bishop Aringarosa, head of religious sect Opus Dei and Silas' mentor, realizing that Silas has been used to murder innocent people, rushes to help the police find him. When the police find Silas hiding in an Opus Dei Center, Silas assumes that they are there to kill him and he rushes out, accidentally shooting Bishop Aringarosa. Bishop Aringarosa survives but is informed that Silas was found dead later from a gunshot wound.The final message inside the second keystone leads Neveu and Langdon to Rosslyn Chapel, whose docent turns out to be Neveu's long-lost brother, whom Neveu had been told died as a child in the car accident that killed her parents. The guardian of Rosslyn Chapel, Marie Chauvel Saint Clair, is Neveu's long-lost grandmother and Saunière's wife who was the woman who participated with him in the \"sacred marriage\". It is revealed that Neveu and her brother are descendants of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. The Priory of Sion hid her identity to protect her from possible threats to her life. The real meaning of the last message is that the Grail is buried beneath the small pyramid directly below La Pyramide Inversée, the inverted glass pyramid of the Louvre. It also lies beneath the \"Rose Line\", an allusion to \"Rosslyn\". Langdon figures out this final piece to the puzzle; he follows the Rose Line (prime meridian) to La Pyramide Inversée, where he kneels to pray before the hidden sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene, as the Templar knights did before.Robert Langdon: A professor of symbology at Harvard University and the protagonist of the novel.

Rowling's Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.[6] As of 2016, it had sold 80 million copies worldwide.[7]Historical inaccuracies\n[edit]Main article: Criticism of The Da Vinci CodeThe Da Vinci Code generated criticism when it was first published for the fictitious description of the core aspects of Christianity and descriptions of European art, history, and architecture. The book has received negative reviews mostly from Catholic and other Christian communities. Many critics took issue with the level of research Brown did when writing the story. The New York Times writer Laura Miller characterized the novel as \"based on a notorious hoax\", \"rank nonsense\", and \"bogus\", saying the book is heavily based on the fabrications of Pierre Plantard, who is asserted to have created the Priory of Sion in 1956.[8]Critics accuse Brown of distorting and fabricating history. Theological author Marcia Ford considered that novels should be judged not on their literary merit, but on their conclusions:Richard Abanes wrote:Much of the controversy generated by The Da Vinci Code was due to the fact that the book was marketed as being historically accurate; the novel opens with a \"fact\" page that states that \"The Priory of Sion—a French secret society founded in 1099—is a real organization\", which is disputed. [10] The fact page itself is part of the novel as a fictional piece, but is not presented as such. The page also states that \"all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents ... and secret rituals in this novel are accurate\", a claim disputed by numerous academic scholars and experts in numerous areas.[11]Brown addressed the idea of some of the more controversial aspects being fact on his website, stating that the page at the beginning of the novel mentions only \"documents, rituals, organization, artwork and architecture\" but not any of the ancient theories discussed by fictional characters, stating that \"Interpreting those ideas is left to the reader\". Brown also says, \"It is my belief that some of the theories discussed by these characters may have merit\" and \"the secret behind The Da Vinci Code was too well documented and significant for me to dismiss.\"[12]In 2003, while promoting the novel, Brown was asked in interviews what parts of the history in his novel actually happened. He replied \"Absolutely all of it.\"[13] In a 2003 interview with CNN's Martin Savidge he was again asked how much of the historical background was true. He replied, \"99% is true... the background is all true\".[14] Asked by Elizabeth Vargas in an ABC News special if the book would have been different if he had written it as non-fiction he replied, \"I don't think it would have.\"[15]In 2005, UK TV personality Tony Robinson edited and narrated a detailed rebuttal of the main arguments of Brown and those of Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln, who authored the book Holy Blood, Holy Grail, in the program The Real Da Vinci Code, shown on British TV Channel 4. The program featured lengthy interviews with many of the main protagonists cited by Brown as \"absolute fact\" in The Da Vinci Code. Arnaud de Sède, son of Gérard de Sède, stated categorically that his father and Plantard had made up the existence of the Prieuré de Sion, the cornerstone of the Jesus bloodline theory: \"frankly, it was piffle\",[16] noting that the concept of a descendant of Jesus was also an element of the 1999 Kevin Smith film Dogma.The earliest appearance of this theory is due to the 13th-century Cistercian monk and chronicler Peter of Vaux de Cernay who reported that Cathars believed that the 'evil' and 'earthly' Jesus Christ had a relationship with Mary Magdalene, described as his concubine (and that the 'good Christ' was incorporeal and existed spiritually in the body of Paul).[17] The program The Real Da Vinci Code also cast doubt on the Rosslyn Chapel association with the Grail and on other related stories, such as the alleged landing of Mary Magdalene in France.According to The Da Vinci Code, the Roman Emperor Constantine I suppressed Gnosticism because it portrayed Jesus as purely human.[18] The novel portrays Constantine as wanting Christianity to act as a unifying religion for the Roman Empire, thinking that Christianity would appeal to pagans only if it featured a demigod similar to pagan heroes. According to the Gnostic Gospels, Jesus was merely a human prophet, not a demigod. Therefore, to change Jesus' image, Constantine destroyed the Gnostic Gospels and promoted the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, which portray Jesus as divine or semi-divine; however, most scholars agree that all Gnostic writings depict Christ as purely divine, his human body being a mere illusion (docetism).[19] Gnostic sects saw Christ this way because they regarded matter as evil, and therefore believed that a divine spirit would never have taken on a material body.[20]Literary reception\n[edit]The book received both positive and negative reviews from critics, and it has been the subject of negative appraisals concerning its portrayal of history. Its writing and historical accuracy were reviewed negatively by The New Yorker,[21]Salon.com,[22] and Maclean's.[23]Positive\n[edit]Janet Maslin of The New York Times said that one word \"concisely conveys the kind of extreme enthusiasm with which this riddle-filled, code-breaking, exhilaratingly brainy thriller can be recommended. That word is wow. The author is Dan Brown (a name you will want to remember). In this gleefully erudite suspense novel, Mr. Brown takes the format he has been developing through three earlier novels and fine-tunes it to blockbuster perfection.\"[24] David Lazarus of The San Francisco Chronicle said, \"This story has so many twists—all satisfying, most unexpected—that it would be a sin to reveal too much of the plot in advance. Let's just say that if this novel doesn't get your pulse racing, you need to check your meds.\"[25] The book appeared at number 43 on a 2010 list of 101 best books ever written, which was derived from a survey of more than 15,000 Australian readers.[26]Disparaging\n[edit]Stephen King likened Brown's work to \"Jokes for the John\", calling such literature the \"intellectual equivalent of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese\".[27]Roger Ebert described it as a \"potboiler written with little grace and style\", although he added it did \"supply an intriguing plot\".[28] In his review of the film National Treasure, whose plot also involves ancient conspiracies and treasure hunts, he wrote: \"I should read a potboiler like The Da Vinci Code every once in a while, just to remind myself that life is too short to read books like The Da Vinci Code.\"[29] While interviewing Umberto Eco in a 2008 issue of The Paris Review, Lila Azam Zanganeh characterized The Da Vinci Code as \"a bizarre little offshoot\" of Eco's novel, Foucault's Pendulum. In response, Eco remarked, \"Dan Brown is a character from Foucault's Pendulum! I invented him. He shares my characters' fascinations—the world conspiracy of Rosicrucians, Masons, and Jesuits. The role of the Knights Templar. The hermetic secret. The principle that everything is connected. I suspect Dan Brown might not even exist.\"[30]Negative\n[edit]Salman Rushdie said during a lecture, \"Do not start me on The Da Vinci Code. A novel so bad that it gives bad novels a bad name.\"[31]Stephen Fry has referred to Brown's writings as \"complete loose stool-water\" and \"arse gravy of the worst kind\".[32] In a live chat on June 14, 2006, he clarified, \"I just loathe all those book[s] about the Holy Grail and Masons and Catholic conspiracies and all that botty-dribble. I mean, there's so much more that's interesting and exciting in art and in history. It plays to the worst and laziest in humanity, the desire to think the worst of the past and the desire to feel superior to it in some fatuous way.\"[33]A. O. Scott, reviewing the movie based on the book for The New York Times, called the book \"Dan Brown's best-selling primer on how not to write an English sentence\".[34]The New Yorker reviewer Anthony Lane refers to it as \"unmitigated junk\" and decries \"the crumbling coarseness of the style\".[21] Linguist Geoffrey Pullum and others posted several entries critical of Brown's writing, at Language Log, calling Brown one of the \"worst prose stylists in the history of literature\" and saying Brown's \"writing is not just bad; it is staggeringly, clumsily, thoughtlessly, almost ingeniously bad\".[35]Lawsuits\n[edit]Author Lewis Perdue alleged that Brown plagiarized two of his novels, The Da Vinci Legacy, originally published in 1983, and Daughter of God, originally published in 2000. He sought to block distribution of the book and film. However, Judge George Daniels of the US District Court in New York ruled against Perdue in 2005, saying that \"A reasonable average lay observer would not conclude that The Da Vinci Code is substantially similar to Daughter of God\" and that \"Any slightly similar elements are on the level of generalized or otherwise unprotectable ideas.\"[36] Perdue appealed; the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the original decision, saying Mr. Perdue's arguments were \"without merit\".[37]In early 2006, Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh filed suit against Brown's publisher, Random House. They alleged that significant portions of The Da Vinci Code were plagiarized from The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, violating their copyright.[38] Brown confirmed during the court case that he named the principal Grail expert of his story Leigh Teabing, an anagram of \"Baigent Leigh\", after the two plaintiffs. In reply to the suggestion that Henry Lincoln was also referred to in the book, since he has medical problems resulting in a severe limp, like the character of Leigh Teabing, Brown stated he was unaware of Lincoln's illness and the correspondence was a coincidence.[39] Since Baigent and Leigh had presented their conclusions as historical research, not as fiction, Mr Justice Peter Smith, who presided over the trial, deemed that a novelist must be free to use these ideas in a fictional context, and ruled against Baigent and Leigh. Smith also hid his own secret code in his written judgment, in the form of seemingly random italicized letters in the 71-page document, which apparently spell out a message. Smith indicated he would confirm the code if someone broke it.[40] After losing before the High Court on July 12, 2006, Baigent and Leigh appealed to the Court of Appeal, unsuccessfully.[39][40]In April 2006 Mikhail Anikin, a Russian scientist and art historian working as a senior researcher at the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, stated the intention to bring a lawsuit against Brown, maintaining that he was the one who coined the phrase used as the book's title and one of the ideas regarding the Mona Lisa used in its plot. Anikin interprets the Mona Lisa to be a Christian allegory consisting of two images, one of Jesus Christ that comprises the image's right half, and one of the Virgin Mary that forms its left half. According to Anikin, he expressed this idea to a group of experts from the Museum of Houston during a 1988 René Magritte exhibit at the Hermitage, and when one of the Americans requested permission to pass it along to a friend Anikin granted the request on condition that he be credited in any book using his interpretation. Anikin eventually compiled his research into Leonardo da Vinci or Theology on Canvas, a book published in 2000, but The Da Vinci Code, published three years later, makes no mention of Anikin and instead asserts that the idea in question is a \"well-known opinion of a number of scientists\".[41][42]Brown has been sued twice in U.S. Federal courts by the author Jack Dunn who claims Brown copied a huge part of his book The Vatican Boys to write The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons. Neither lawsuit was allowed to go to a jury trial. In 2017, in London, another claim was begun against Brown by Jack Dunn who claimed that justice was not served in the U.S. lawsuits.[43] Possibly the largest reaction occurred in Kolkata, India, where a group of around 25 protesters \"stormed\" Crossword bookstore, pulled copies of the book from the racks, and threw them to the ground. On the same day, a group of 50–60 protesters successfully made the Oxford Bookstore on Park Street decide to stop selling the book \"until the controversy sparked by the film's release was resolved\".[44] Thus in 2006, seven Indian states (Nagaland, Punjab, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh) banned the release or exhibition of the Hollywood movie The Da Vinci Code (as well as the book).[45] Later, two states, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, lifted the ban under high court order.[46][47]The book has been translated into over 44 languages, primarily hardcover.[48] Major English-language (hardcover) editions include:Main article: The Da Vinci Code (film)Columbia Pictures adapted the novel to film, with a screenplay written by Akiva Goldsman, and Academy Award winner Ron Howard directing. The film was released on May 19, 2006, and stars Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon, Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu, and Sir Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing. During its opening weekend, moviegoers spent an estimated $77 million in America, and $224 million worldwide.[50]The movie received mixed reviews. Roger Ebert in its review wrote that \"Ron Howard is a better filmmaker than Dan Brown is a novelist; he follows Brown's formula (exotic location, startling revelation, desperate chase scene, repeat as needed) and elevates it into a superior entertainment, with Tom Hanks as a theo-intellectual Indiana Jones... it's involving, intriguing and constantly seems on the edge of startling revelations.\"[28]The film received two sequels: Angels & Demons, released in 2009, and Inferno, released in 2016.

{"title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","author":"J. K. Rowling","published":1998,"fiction":true,"plot":"While spending the summer with the Dursleys, the twelve-year-old Harry Potter is visited by Dobby, a house-elf. Dobby says Harry is in danger and must promise not to return to Hogwarts. When Harry refuses, Dobby uses magic to destroy a pudding made by Aunt Petunia. Believing that Harry created the mess, Uncle Vernon locks him in his room. The Ministry of Magic sends a notice accusing Harry of performing underage magic and threatening to expel him from Hogwarts.The Weasley brothers Ron, Fred, and George arrive in their father's flying car and take Harry to their home. When Harry and the Weasleys go to Diagon Alley for school supplies, they meet Gilderoy Lockhart, a celebrity author who is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. At King's Cross station, Harry and Ron cannot enter Platform 9¾ to board the Hogwarts Express, so they fly to Hogwarts in the enchanted car.During the school year, Harry hears a strange voice emanating from the castle walls. Argus Filch's cat is found Petrified, along with a warning scrawled on the wall: \"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware\". Harry learns that the Chamber supposedly houses a monster that attacks Muggle-born students, and which only the Heir of Slytherin can control. During a Quidditch match, a rogue Bludger strikes Harry, breaking his arm. Professor Lockhart botches an attempt to mend it, which sends Harry to the hospital wing. Dobby visits Harry and reveals that he jinxed the Bludger and sealed the portal at King's Cross. He also tells Harry that house-elves are bound to serve a master, and cannot be freed unless their master gives them clothing.After another attack from the monster, students attend a defensive duelling class. During the class, Harry displays the rare ability to speak Parseltongue, the language of snakes. Moaning Myrtle, a ghost who haunts a bathroom, shows Harry and his friends a diary that was left in her stall. It belonged to Tom Riddle, a student who witnessed another student's death when the Chamber was last opened. During the next attack by the monster, Hermione Granger is petrified.Harry and Ron discover that the monster is a Basilisk, a gigantic snake that can kill victims with a direct gaze and Petrify them with an indirect gaze. Harry realizes the Basilisk is producing the voice he hears in the walls. After Ron's sister Ginny is abducted and taken into the Chamber, Harry and Ron discover the Chamber entrance in Myrtle's bathroom. When they force Lockhart to enter with them, he confesses that the stories he told of his heroic adventures are fabrications. He attempts to erase the boys' memories, but his spell backfires and obliterates his own memory.Harry finds an unconscious Ginny in the Chamber. A manifestation of Tom Riddle appears and reveals that he is Lord Voldemort and the Heir of Slytherin. After explaining that he opened the Chamber, Riddle summons the Basilisk to kill Harry. Dumbledore's phoenix Fawkes arrives, bringing Harry the Sorting Hat. While Fawkes blinds the Basilisk, Harry pulls the Sword of Gryffindor from the Hat. He slays the serpent, then stabs the diary with a Basilisk fang, destroying it and the manifestation of Riddle. Later, Harry liberates Dobby by tricking his master into giving him clothing. At the end of the novel, the Petrified students are cured and Gryffindor wins the House Cup.Development\n[edit]J. K. Rowling found it difficult to finish Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets because she was afraid it would not live up to the expectations raised by Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. After delivering the manuscript to Bloomsbury on schedule, she took it back for six weeks of revision.[1]In early drafts of the book, the ghost Nearly Headless Nick sang a self-composed song explaining his condition and the circumstances of his unknown death. This was cut because the book's editor did not care for the poem, which has been subsequently published as an extra on J. K. Rowling's official website.[2] The family background of Dean Thomas was removed because Rowling and her publishers considered it an \"unnecessary digression,\" and she considered Neville Longbottom's own journey of discovery \"more important to the central plot.\"[3]Gilderoy Lockhart's character was inspired by an acquaintance of Rowling who was, in her words, \"even more objectionable than his fictional counterpart\" and \"used to tell whopping great fibs about his past life, all of them designed to demonstrate what a wonderful, brave and brilliant person he was.\"[4]Publication\n[edit]Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999.[5][6] It immediately took first place in UK bestseller lists, displacing popular authors such as John Grisham, Tom Clancy[1] and Terry Pratchett,[7] and making Rowling the first author to win the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year for two years in succession.[8] In June 1999, it went straight to the top of three US bestseller lists,[9] including in The New York Times.[10]First edition printings had several errors, which were fixed in subsequent reprints.[11] Initially, Dumbledore said Voldemort was the last remaining ancestor of Salazar Slytherin instead of his descendant.[11]Gilderoy Lockhart's book on werewolves is entitled Weekends with Werewolves at one point and Wanderings with Werewolves later in the book.[12]Critical response\n[edit]In The Times, Deborah Loudon described it as a children's book that would be \"re-read into adulthood\" and highlighted its \"strong plots, engaging characters, excellent jokes and a moral message which flows naturally from the story\".[13] Fantasy author Charles de Lint agreed, and considered the second Harry Potter book to be just as good as Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, a rare achievement among series of books.[14] Thomas Wagner regarded the plot as very similar to that of the first book, based on searching for a secret hidden under the school. However, he enjoyed the parody of celebrities and their fans that centres round Gilderoy Lockhart, and approved of the book's handling of racism.[15] Tammy Nezol found the book more disturbing than its predecessor, particularly in the rash behaviour of Harry and his friends after Harry withholds information from Dumbledore, and in the human-like behaviour of the mandragoras used to make a potion that cures petrification. Nevertheless, she considered the second story as enjoyable as the first.[16]Mary Stuart thought the final conflict with Tom Riddle in the Chamber was almost as scary as in some of Stephen King's works, and perhaps too strong for young or timid children. She commented that \"there are enough surprises and imaginative details thrown in as would normally fill five lesser books.\" Like other reviewers, she thought the book would give pleasure to both children and adult readers.[17] According to Philip Nel, the early reviews gave unalloyed praise while the later ones included some criticisms, although they still agreed that the book was outstanding.[18]Writing after all seven books had been published, Graeme Davis regarded Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as the weakest of the series, and agreed that the plot structure is much the same as in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. He described Fawkes's appearance to arm Harry and then to heal him as a deus ex machina: he said that the book does not explain how Fawkes knew where to find Harry; and Fawkes's timing had to be very precise, as arriving earlier would probably have prevented the battle with the basilisk, while arriving later would have been fatal to Harry and Ginny.[19]Awards and honours\n[edit]Rowling's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was the recipient of several awards.[20] The American Library Association listed the novel among its 2000 Notable Children's Books,[21] as well as its Best Books for Young Adults.[22] In 1999, Booklist named Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as one of its Editors' Choices,[23] and as one of its Top Ten Fantasy Novels for Youth.[20] The Cooperative Children's Book Center made the novel a CCBC Choice of 2000 in the \"Fiction for Children\" category.[24] The novel also won Children's Book of the Year British Book Award,[25] and was shortlisted for the 1998 Guardian Children's Award and the 1998 Carnegie Award.[20]Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets won the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize 1998 Gold Medal in the 9–11 years division.[25] Rowling also won two other Nestlé Smarties Book Prizes for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. The Scottish Arts Council awarded their first ever Children's Book Award to the novel in 1999,[26] and it was also awarded Whitaker's Platinum Book Award in 2001.[20][27] In 2003, the novel was listed at number 23 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.[28]Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets continues to examine what makes a person who he or she is, which began in the first book. As well as maintaining that Harry's identity is shaped by his decisions rather than any aspect of his birth,[16][29]Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets provides contrasting characters who try to conceal their true personalities: as Tammy Nezol puts it, Gilderoy Lockhart \"lacks any real identity\" because he is nothing more than a charming liar.[16] Riddle also complicates Harry's struggle to understand himself by pointing out the similarities between the two: \"both half-bloods, orphans raised by Muggles, probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin.\"[30]Opposition to class, death and its impacts, experiencing adolescence, sacrifice, love, friendship, loyalty, prejudice, and racism are constant themes of the series. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry's consideration and respect for others extends to the lowly, non-human Dobby and the ghost Nearly Headless Nick.[31] According to Marguerite Krause, achievements in the novel depend more on ingenuity and hard work than on natural talents.[32]Edward Duffy, associate professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of Chamber of Secrets is Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas.[33] Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat room system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.[34]Antonello Fabio Caterino, an Italian forensic linguist and philologist, stated that the conversations Harry and Voldemort had through the diary could be considered a \"modern transposition\" of Petrarca's Secretum, a text often compared to a diary, which details an imaginary dialogue between the writer and Augustine of Hippo. Caterino analysed similarities between themes found in both books, starting from the idea of a fragmented soul: Harry and Voldemort are both seeking Voldemort's Horcruxes, which are fragments of his soul, and Petrarca also focuses on the concept animae fragmenta, meaning soul's fragments.[35]Immorality and the portrayal of authority as negative are significant themes in the novel. Marguerite Krause states there are few absolute moral rules in Harry Potter's world, for example Harry prefers to tell the truth, but lies whenever he considers it necessary – very like his enemy Draco Malfoy.[32] At the end of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Dumbledore retracts his promise to punish Harry and Ron if they break any more school rules – after Professor McGonagall estimates they have broken over 100 – and lavishly rewards them for ending the threat from the Chamber of Secrets.[36] Krause further states that authority figures and political institutions receive little respect from Rowling.[32] William MacNeil of Griffith University, Queensland, Australia states that the Minister for Magic is presented as a mediocrity.[37] In his article \"Harry Potter and the Secular City\", Ken Jacobson suggests the Ministry as a whole is portrayed as a tangle of bureaucratic empires, saying that \"Ministry officials busy themselves with minutiae (e.g. standardising cauldron thicknesses) and coin politically correct euphemisms like 'non-magical community' (for Muggles) and 'memory modification' (for magical brainwashing).\"[29]This novel implies it begins in 1992: the cake for Nearly-Headless Nick's 500th deathday party bears the words \"Sir Nicholas De Mimsy Porpington died 31 October 1492\".[38][39]Connection to Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n[edit]Chamber of Secrets has many links with the sixth book of the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. In fact, Half-Blood Prince was the working title of Chamber of Secrets and Rowling says she originally intended to present some \"crucial pieces of information\" in the second book, but ultimately felt \"this information's proper home was book six\".[40] Some objects that play significant roles in Half-Blood Prince first appear in Chamber of Secrets: the Hand of Glory and the opal necklace that are on sale in Borgin and Burkes; a Vanishing Cabinet in Hogwarts that is damaged by Peeves the Poltergeist; and Tom Riddle's diary, which is later revealed to be a Horcrux.[41] Additionally, these two novels are the ones with the most focus on Harry's relationship with Ginny Weasley.Film\n[edit]Main article: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)The film version of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was released in 2002.[42]Chris Columbus directed the film,[43] and the screenplay was written by Steve Kloves. It became the third film to exceed $600 million in international box office sales, preceded by Titanic, released in 1997, and Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, released in 2001.[44] The film was nominated for a Saturn Award for the Best Fantasy Film,[44][45] According to Metacritic, the film version of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets received \"generally favourable reviews\" with an average score of 63%,[46] and another aggregator, Rotten Tomatoes, gave it a score of 82%.[43]Video games\n[edit]Main article: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)Five unique video games by different developers were released between 2002 and 2003 by Electronic Arts, loosely based on the book:^ a b Sexton, Colleen (2007). \"Pottermania\".

{"title":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","author":"J. K. Rowling","published":1999,"fiction":true,"plot":"During the summer, Harry accidentally performs magic at the home of his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon by blowing up his Aunt Marge, causing her to float into the sky. After this incident, he leaves their house and travels to London by The Knight Bus. At London, he spends his summer there. While staying at the Leaky Cauldron inn, Harry is visited by Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, who warns him about Sirius Black, a mass-murderer who escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban.With Black at large, Dementors have been stationed at Hogwarts as a security measure. During a Care of Magical Creatures lesson with Hagrid, Draco Malfoy is injured after provoking a hippogriff named Buckbeak. Draco's father, Lucius Malfoy, gets Hagrid put on trial for owning a dangerous creature. Harry repeatedly faints in the presence of the Dementors, but eventually is taught by Professor Lupin, a new teacher, how to repel them using the Patronus Charm. When Harry is unable to participate in weekend trips to Hogsmeade Village, Fred and George give him a magical map that shows him how to get there using a secret passage. At the Three Broomsticks pub, Harry overhears that Black is his godfather, that he betrayed Harry's parents to Voldemort, and that he now seeks to kill Harry as well.When Ron's pet rat Scabbers disappears, he blames Hermione and her cat Crookshanks. Ron and Hermione stop talking to each other, although Hermione is distraught when Ron survives an attack by Black inside the Gryffindor dormitory. After the attack, Black cannot be found. After Harry, Ron and Hermione learn that Buckbeak will be executed, they console Hagrid, and Ron and Hermione resume their friendship. Ron also finds Scabbers, who was hiding in Hagrid's hut. As the friends make their way back to the castle, Ron is attacked by a large black dog, which drags him through the passageway leading to Hogsmeade. Harry and Hermione give chase, and find themselves in the Shrieking Shack, where the dog is revealed to be Black in his Animagus form. Lupin arrives, and Black states that he intends to kill Scabbers, not Harry. He explains that Scabbers is Peter Pettigrew, who betrayed Harry's parents to Voldemort and framed Black for mass murder. Black and Lupin compel Pettigrew to transform into human form, then haul him back to Hogwarts.On the way to the castle, the full moon causes Lupin to transform into a werewolf. Pettigrew escapes and is pursued by Black, Harry and Hermione, who encounter Dementors and lose consciousness. They awaken in the castle, where Black is now being held captive. Harry and Hermione proclaim his innocence to Dumbledore, who suggests using Hermione's Time Turner. Harry and Hermione travel back in time and save both Black and Buckbeak, who fly away together. Snape blames Lupin for Black's disappearance and makes his werewolf-identity public, which forces Lupin to resign. On the train back to London, Harry receives a letter from Black, expressing his gratitude for saving his life.Pre-release history\n[edit]Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third book in the Harry Potter series. The first, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published by Bloomsbury on 26 June 1997 and the second, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was published on 2 July 1998.[6] Rowling started to write the Prisoner of Azkaban the day after she finished The Chamber of Secrets.[7] Rowling said in 2004 that Prisoner of Azkaban was \"the best writing experience I ever had...I was in a very comfortable place writing (number) three. Immediate financial worries were over, and press attention wasn't yet by any means excessive\".[8]Critical reception\n[edit]Gregory Maguire wrote a review in The New York Times for Prisoner of Azkaban: in it he said, \"So far, in terms of plot, the books do nothing new, but they do it brilliantly...so far, so good.\"[9] In a newspaper review in The New York Times, it was said that \"'The Prisoner of Azkaban' may be the best 'Harry Potter' book yet\".[10] A reviewer for KidsReads said, \"This crisply-paced fantasy will leave you hungry for the four additional Harry books that J.K. Rowling is working on. Harry's third year is a charm. Don't miss it.\"[11]Kirkus Reviews did not give a starred review but said, \"a properly pulse-pounding climax...The main characters and the continuing story both come along so smartly...that the book seems shorter than its page count: have readers clear their calendars if they are fans, or get out of the way if they are not.\"[12] Martha V. Parravano also gave a positive review for The Horn Book Magazine, calling it \"quite a good book.\"[13] In addition, a Publishers Weekly review said, \"Rowling's wit never flags, whether constructing the workings of the wizard world...or tossing off quick jokes...The Potter spell is holding strong\".[14]However, Anthony Holden, who was one of the judges against Prisoner of Azkaban for the Whitbread Award, was negative about the book, saying that the characters are \"all black-and-white\", and the \"story-lines are predictable, the suspense minimal, the sentimentality cloying every page\".[15]In 2012 it was ranked number 12 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published by School Library Journal.[16]Awards\n[edit]Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban won several awards, including the 1999 Booklist Editors' Choice Award,[17] the 1999 Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers,[18] the 1999 FCBG Children's Book Award,[19] the 1999 Whitbread Book of the Year for children's books,[20] and the 2000 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel.[21] It was also nominated for the 2000 Hugo Award for Best Novel, the first in the series nominated, but lost to A Deepness in the Sky.[22]Prisoner of Azkaban additionally won the 2004 Indian Paintbrush Book Award[23] and the 2004 Colorado Blue Spruce Young Adult Book Award.[24] Additionally, it was named an American Library Association Notable Children's Book in 2000[25] as well as one of their Best Books for Young Adults.[26] As with the previous two books in the series, Prisoner of Azkaban won the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize Gold Medal for children aged 9–11 and made the top of the New York Times Best Seller list.[27] In both cases, it was the last in the series to do so.[28] However, in the latter case, a Children's Best Sellers list was created just before the release of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in July 2000 in order to free up more room on the original list.[29] In 2003, the novel was listed at number 24 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.[30]Sales\n[edit]Prisoner of Azkaban sold more than 64,000 copies in the UK within three days of publication, which made it the fastest selling British book of the time.[5] The sales total by 2012 is said by The Guardian to be 3,377,906.[3]Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was issued, prior to publication, in two distinct UK proof editions, and one US \"Advance Reader's Edition\".[31] The first UK proof, in purple wrappers, differs from the second in a number of respects, and is thought to have been printed in a small edition of 50 copies.[31] The second UK proof is in green wrappers and was printed in a somewhat larger run.[32][33] The US Advance Reader's Edition is the last of its kind in the Harry Potter series,[citation needed] as no Advance Reader's Editions are known for books 4 through 7.[citation needed] The rear wrapper of the Advance Reader's Edition reveals the circumstances of the US publication of the book:Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was released in hardcover in the UK on 8 July 1999[34] and in the US on 8 September.[34] The UK edition was released at the unusually precise time of 3.45pm, so as to avoid children skipping school in order to purchase the book.[31] The first state of the hardback edition features an error on p. 7, with an unintended carriage return in a block quote. Two further issues were released, both fixing the error. Across all three states, 5,150 were printed by Clays Ltd.[31]The British paperback edition was released on 1 April 2000,[35] while the US paperback was released 1 October 2001.[36]Bloomsbury additionally released an adult edition with a different cover design to the original, in paperback on 10 July 2004[37] and in hardcover in October 2004.[38] A hardcover special edition, featuring a green border and signature, was released on 8 July 1999.[34] In May 2004, Bloomsbury released a Celebratory Edition, with a blue and purple border.[39] On 1 November 2010, they released the 10th anniversary Signature edition illustrated by Clare Mellinsky and in July 2013 a new adult cover illustrated by Andrew Davidson, both these editions were designed by Webb & Webb Design Limited.[40]Beginning on 27 August 2013, Scholastic will release new covers for the paperback editions of Harry Potter in the United States to celebrate 15 years of the series.[41] The covers were designed by the author and illustrator Kazu Kibuishi.[42]An illustrated version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was released on 3 October 2017, and was illustrated by Jim Kay, who illustrated the previous two instalments. This includes over 115 new illustrations and will be followed by Illustrated editions of the following 4 novels in the future.[43] Jim Kay announced on 6 October 2022 that he would not be illustrating the final two Harry Potter books and that his last work, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, would be released on 11 October 2022.[43]Film\n[edit]Main article: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)The film version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was released in 2004 and was directed by Alfonso Cuarón from a screenplay by Steve Kloves.[44] The film débuted at number one at the box office and held that position for two weeks.[45] It made a total of $796.7 million worldwide,[46] which made it the second highest-grossing film of 2004 behind Shrek 2. However, among all eight entries in the Harry Potter franchise, Prisoner of Azkaban grossed the lowest; yet among critics and fans, the film is often cited as the best in the franchise – in large part due to Cuarón's stylistic influence.[47][48] The film ranks at number 471 in Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.[49]Video games\n[edit]Main article: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)Three unique video games by different developers were released in 2004 by Electronic Arts, loosely based on the book:^ \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban by J.K.

{"title":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire","author":"J. K. Rowling","published":2000,"fiction":true,"plot":"During the summer, there is an attack at the Quidditch World Cup. The cloaked assailants resemble Death Eaters, the followers of Voldemort. When the school term begins at Hogwarts, Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody is introduced as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Dumbledore announces that students from the foreign wizarding schools Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving at Hogwarts to participate in the Triwizard Tournament. An artefact called the Goblet of Fire is placed in the main hall, and students are invited to nominate themselves for the tournament by putting their name into it. Although Harry does not nominate himself, he is mysteriously selected to compete against the older students Cedric Diggory, Fleur Delacour, and Viktor Krum.Harry is interviewed by the Daily Prophet reporter Rita Skeeter, who writes a scathing article portraying him as a disturbed attention-seeker. Using the Hogwarts Floo Network, Harry speaks with his godfather, Sirius Black, who warns him about the Durmstrang principal, Igor Karkaroff, who is a former Death Eater. Sirius believes Harry's selection for the dangerous tournament is somehow connected to the attack at the World Cup. Hagrid alerts Harry that the First Task involves a dragon. After Moody reminds Harry that he is an expert flyer, Harry uses his broomstick to fly past the dragon and accomplish the task.As Christmas approaches, Harry asks a girl named Cho Chang to the Yule Ball, but she is already going with Cedric. Harry and Ron end up going to the ball with the twin sisters Parvati and Padma Patil. Ron is sullen as he observes Hermione dancing with Krum. As the Second Task nears, Harry learns that he will need to rescue someone from the lake. The house-elf Dobby gives him Gillyweed, which allows him to breathe underwater long enough to rescue both Ron and Fleur's sister Gabrielle. He is awarded extra points for his bravery and is tied for first place.In the Third Task, Harry and his competitors must navigate a maze of obstacles to reach the Triwizard Cup. Harry and Cedric reach the Cup at the same time and decide to grab it together. They are immediately transported to a graveyard, where Peter Pettigrew kills Cedric and subdues Harry. Using Harry's blood, he performs a ritual that returns Voldemort to bodily form. As Voldemort and Harry duel, their wands magically connect. This distraction allows Harry the chance to escape back to Hogwarts with the Cup and Cedric's body.Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape discover that Moody is actually the Death Eater Barty Crouch Jr. When they administer him a truth potion, he reveals that he placed Harry's name in the Goblet, supported him through the Tasks, and ensured he was transported to the graveyard for the ritual. Crouch Jr is handed over to the Dementors, who render him soulless with the Dementor's Kiss. Recovering in the hospital wing, Harry narrates the events to Cedric's parents. He offers them his tournament winnings, but they refuse it, so he gives the gold to Fred and George Weasley so they can open their joke shop. During a memorial service for Cedric, Dumbledore tells the students at Hogwarts that Voldemort has returned.Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth book in the Harry Potter series. The first, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published by Bloomsbury on 26 June 1997. The second, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was published on 2 July 1998. The third, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, followed on 8 July 1999.[1]Goblet of Fire is almost twice the size of the first three books (the paperback edition was 636 pages). Rowling stated that she \"knew from the beginning it would be the biggest of the first four.\" She said there needed to be a \"proper run-up\" for the conclusion and rushing the \"complex plot\" could confuse readers. She also stated that \"everything is on a bigger scale,\" which was symbolic, as Harry's horizons widened both literally and metaphorically as he grew up. She also wanted to explore more of the magical world.[2]Until the official title's announcement on 27 June 2000, the book was called by its working title, \"Harry Potter IV\". Previously, in April, the publisher had listed it as Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament. However,[3] J. K. Rowling expressed her indecision about the title in an Entertainment Weekly interview. \"I changed my mind twice on what [the title] was. The working title had got out — Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament. Then I changed Doomspell to Triwizard Tournament. Then I was teetering between Goblet of Fire and Triwizard Tournament. In the end, I preferred Goblet of Fire because it's got that kind of cup of destiny feel about it, which is the theme of the book.\"[2]Rowling mentioned that she originally wrote a Weasley relative named Mafalda, who, according to Rowling, \"was the daughter of the 'second cousin who's a stockbroker' mentioned in Philosopher's Stone. This stockbroker had been very rude to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley in the past, but now he and his (Muggle) wife had inconveniently produced a witch, they came back to the Weasleys asking for their help in introducing her to wizarding society before she starts at Hogwarts.\"[4] Mafalda was supposed to be a Slytherin and was to fill in the Rita Skeeter subplot, but she was eventually removed because \"there were obvious limitations to what an eleven-year-old closeted at school could discover.\" Rowling considered Rita Skeeter to be \"much more flexible.\"[4] Rowling also admitted that the fourth book was the most difficult to write at the time because the Mafalda character also served as a giant plot hole, which she discovered halfway through writing.[2]Jeff Jensen, who interviewed Rowling for Entertainment Weekly in 2000, pointed out that bigotry is a big theme in the Harry Potter novels and Goblet of Fire in particular. He mentioned how Voldemort and his followers are prejudiced against Muggles and how, in Goblet of Fire, Hermione forms a group to liberate Hogwarts' house-elves who have \"been indentured servants so long they lack desire for anything else.\"[2] When asked why she explored this theme, Rowling replied,She also commented that she did not feel this was too \"heavy\" for children, as it was one of those things that a \"huge number of children at that age start to think about.\"[2]UK/US release\n[edit]Goblet of Fire was the first book in the Harry Potter series to be released in the United States on the same date as the United Kingdom, on 8 July 2000, strategically on a Saturday so children did not have to worry about school conflicting with buying the book.[1] It had a combined first-printing of over five million copies.[1] It was given a record-breaking print run of 3.9 million. Three million copies of the book were sold over the first weekend in the US alone.[5]FedEx dispatched more than 9,000 trucks and 100 planes to fulfil book deliveries.[6] The pressure in editing caused a mistake which shows Harry's father emerging first from Voldemort's wand; however, as confirmed in Prisoner of Azkaban, James died first, so then Harry's mother ought to have come out first.[7] This was corrected in later editions.[8]Launch publicity\n[edit]To publicise the book, a special train named Hogwarts Express was organised by Bloomsbury, and run from King's Cross to Perth, carrying J.K. Rowling, a consignment of books for her to sign and sell, also representatives of Bloomsbury and the press. The book was launched on 8 July 2000, on platform 1 at King's Cross – which had been given \"Platform .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);clip-path:polygon(0px 0px,0px 0px,0px 0px);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px}9+3⁄4\" signs for the occasion – following which the train departed. En route it called at Didcot Railway Centre, Kidderminster, the Severn Valley Railway, Crewe (overnight stop), Manchester, Bradford, York, the National Railway Museum (overnight stop), Newcastle, Edinburgh, arriving at Perth on 11 July.[9] The locomotive was West Country class steam locomotive no. 34027 Taw Valley, which was specially repainted red for the tour; it later returned to its normal green livery (the repaints were requested and paid for by Bloomsbury). The coaches of the train included a sleeping car. A Diesel locomotive was coupled at the other end, for use when reversals were necessary, such as the first stage of the journey as far as Ferme Park, just south of Hornsey. The tour generated considerably more press interest than the launch of the film Thomas and the Magic Railroad which was premiered in London the same weekend.[10][11][12]Critical reception\n[edit]In The New York Times Book Review, author Stephen King stated the Goblet of Fire was \"every bit as good as Potters 1 through 3\" and praised the humour and subplots, although he commented that \"there's also a moderately tiresome amount of adolescent squabbling...it's a teenage thing\".[13]Kirkus Reviews called it \"another grand tale of magic and mystery...and clicking along so smoothly that it seems shorter than it is\". However, they commented that it did tend to lag, especially at the end where two \"bad guys\" stopped the action to give extended explanations, and that the issues to be resolved in sequels would leave \"many readers, particularly American ones, uncomfortable\".[14] For The Horn Book Magazine, Martha V. Parravano gave a mixed review, saying \"some will find [it] wide-ranging, compellingly written, and absorbing; others, long, rambling, and tortuously fraught with adverbs\".[15] A Publishers Weekly review praised the book's \"red herrings, the artful clues and tricky surprises that disarm the most attentive audience\" and saying it \"might be her most thrilling yet.\"[16] Writing for The New Yorker, Joan Acocella noted that \"where the prior volumes moved like lightning, here the pace is slower, the energy more dispersed. At the same time, the tone becomes more grim.\"[17]Kristin Lemmerman of CNN said that it is not great literature: 'Her prose has more in common with your typical beach-blanket fare and the beginning contained too much recap to introduce characters to new readers, although Rowling quickly gets back on track, introducing readers to a host of well-drawn new characters.'[18] Writing for Salon.com, Charles Taylor was generally positive about the change of mood and development of characters.[19]Entertainment Weekly's reviewer Kristen Baldwin gave Goblet of Fire the grade of A−, praising the development of the characters as well as the many themes presented. However, she did worry that a shocking climax may be a \"nightmare factory\" for young readers.[20]In 2012 it was ranked number 98 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published by School Library Journal.[21]In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, major characters deliver memorable lines that capture key themes: Dumbledore warns of the tournament's dangers, Moody introduces the lethal Unforgivable Curses, and Voldemort reveals that his power was undone by love. Through these characters’ journeys, the story conveys themes of friendship, sacrifice, and the unified fight against darkness.[22]Awards and honours\n[edit]Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire won several awards, including the 2001 Hugo Award for Best Novel.[23] It won the 2002 Indian Paintbrush Book Award, the third after Philosopher's Stone and Prisoner of Azkaban.[24] The novel also won an Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Award for one of the best books, who claimed it was \"more intense than the first three books\".[25] In addition, Entertainment Weekly listed Goblet of Fire in second place on their list of The New Classics: Books – The 100 best reads from 1983 to 2008.[26]The Guardian ranked Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire #97 in its list of 100 Best Books of the 21st Century.[27]Film\n[edit]Main article: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was adapted into a film, released worldwide on 18 November 2005, which was directed by Mike Newell and written by Steve Kloves. The film grossed $102.7 million for the opening weekend,[28] and eventually grossed $896 million worldwide.[29] The film was also nominated for Best Art Direction at the 78th Academy Awards.[30]Video game\n[edit]Main article: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (video game)It was also made into a video game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS, GameCube, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, and PlayStation Portable by Electronic Arts.

{"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","author":"J. K. Rowling","published":2003,"fiction":true,"plot":"During the summer, Harry is frustrated by the lack of communication from his friends and by Dumbledore's refusal to let him help in the struggle against Lord Voldemort. One evening, Dementors attack him and his cousin Dudley, but Harry fends them off using the Patronus Charm. Later, members of the Order of the Phoenix arrive at the Dursley residence and take Harry to Number 12, Grimmauld Place. Number 12 is Sirius Black's family home and the headquarters of the Order, which is a secret organisation founded by Dumbledore to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Harry wants to join the Order, but is too young.Under the leadership of Cornelius Fudge, the Ministry of Magic is waging a smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore, claiming they are lying about the return of Voldemort. Harry faces legal charges for the Patronus Charm he performed, but is exonerated and returns to Hogwarts. Dolores Umbridge, a senior Ministry employee, is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. She implements a textbook-only curriculum and forbids the students from practicing defensive spells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione form a secret student group called Dumbledore's Army, which meets in the Room of Requirement to practice defensive magic under Harry's instruction.One night, Harry dreams that Arthur Weasley is attacked by Voldemort's snake, Nagini. The attack actually occurred, and Dumbledore realises that Harry's mind is connected to Voldemort. He orders Professor Snape to teach Harry Occlumency to keep Voldemort out of his mind. When Umbridge discovers Dumbledore's Army, Dumbledore saves Harry from expulsion by claiming he formed the group. To avoid arrest, he goes into hiding. Umbridge is appointed headmistress and begins enacting strict rules and regulations.During exams, Harry has a vision of Voldemort torturing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries. He attempts to contact Sirius at Grimmauld Place, but Umbridge catches and interrogates him. Hermione intervenes and convinces Umbridge to go with her and Harry into the Forbidden Forest. When Umbridge provokes the centaurs who live there, they take her captive. Harry and his friends fly to the Ministry to rescue Sirius, but he is not there. Instead, they find shelves containing glass spheres, one of which bears Harry's name. Harry picks it up and is immediately surrounded by Death Eaters. Lucius Malfoy reveals that Harry was lured to the Ministry by a false vision from Voldemort, who wishes to hear the prophecy contained in the sphere. He asks Harry for the sphere, but Harry refuses to give it to him.The students fight the Death Eaters with help from several Order of the Phoenix members. Neville accidentally knocks the sphere down some steps, destroying it. Bellatrix Lestrange kills Sirius by knocking him through a mysterious stone archway. Voldemort appears and tries to kill Harry, but Dumbledore arrives and thwarts him. Fudge and other Ministry of Magic employees arrive on the scene and witness Voldemort just before he flees. Back at Hogwarts, Dumbledore tells Harry the prophecy was made by Professor Trelawney, who predicted the birth of a child with the power to vanquish Voldemort. This prophecy caused Voldemort to murder Harry's parents, and it is why he wishes to kill Harry as well. Harry feels overwhelmed by the prophecy and the loss of Sirius, but the wizarding community now believes him and respects him. Motivated by his friends, Harry returns to the Dursleys for the summer.Potter fans waited three years between the releases of the fourth and fifth books.[2][3] Before the release of the fifth book, 200 million copies of the first four books had already been sold and translated into 55 languages in 200 countries.[4] As the series was already a global phenomenon, the book forged new pre-order records, with thousands of people queuing outside book stores on 20 June 2003 to secure copies at midnight.[4] Despite the security, thousands of copies were stolen from an Earlestown, Merseyside warehouse on 15 June 2003.[5]Critical response\n[edit]In 2004, the book was cited as an American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults and as an American Library Association Notable Book.[6][7] It also received the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio 2004 Gold Medal, along with several other awards.[8] Rowling was praised for her imagination by USA Today writer Deirdre Donahue.[9]The New York Times writer John Leonard praised the novel, saying \"The Order of the Phoenix starts slow, gathers speed and then skateboards, with somersaults, to its furious conclusion....As Harry gets older, Rowling gets better.\"[10] However, he also criticised \"the one-note Draco Malfoy\" and the predictable Lord Voldemort.[10]Predecessors and sequels\n[edit]Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the fifth book in the Harry Potter series.[2] The first book in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was first published by Bloomsbury in 1997 with an initial print-run of 500 copies in hardback, 300 of which were distributed to libraries. By the end of 1997, the UK edition won a National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9-to-11-year-olds category of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize.[11][12][13] The second novel, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was published in the UK on 2 July 1998. The third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, was published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999.[12][13] The fourth novel, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, was published 8 July 2000, simultaneously by Bloomsbury and Scholastic.[14] The fifth novel, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, is the longest book in the series, yet it is the second-shortest film at 2 hours 18 minutes.[15]After the publishing of Order of the Phoenix, the sixth book of the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was published on 2 April 2005 and sold 9 million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide release.[1][16] The seventh and final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was published 21 July 2007.[17] The book sold 11 million copies within 24 hours of its release: 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US.[16]Film\n[edit]Main article: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)In 2007, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was released in a film version directed by David Yates and written by Michael Goldenberg. The film was produced by David Heyman's company, Heyday Films, alongside David Barron. The budget was reportedly between £75 and 100 million (US$150–200 million),[18][19] and it became the unadjusted eleventh-highest-grossing film of all time and a critical and commercial success.[20] The film opened to a worldwide 5-day opening of $333 million, the third best of all time, and grossed $940 million total, second to Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End for the greatest total of 2007.[21][22]Video games\n[edit]Main article: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)A video game adaptation of the book and film versions of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was made for Microsoft Windows, PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, PSP, Nintendo DS, Wii, Game Boy Advance, and Mac OS X.[23] It was released on 25 June 2007 in the U.S., 28 June 2007 in Australia, and 29 June 2007 in the UK and Europe for PlayStation 3, PSP, PlayStation 2, Windows, and 3 July 2007 for most other platforms.[24] The games were published by Electronic Arts.[25]The book is also depicted in the 2011 video game Lego Harry Potter: Years 5–7.Main article: Harry Potter in translationThe first official foreign translation of the book appeared in Vietnamese on 21 July 2003, when the first of twenty-two instalments was released. The first official European translation appeared in Serbia and Montenegro in Serbian by the official publisher Narodna Knjiga in early September 2003. Other translations appeared later (e.g. in November 2003 in Dutch and German). The English-language version has topped the bestseller list in France, whereas in Germany and the Netherlands, an unofficial distributed translation process was started on the internet.[26]^ a b \"July date for Harry Potter book\".

{"title":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","author":"J. K. Rowling","published":2005,"fiction":true,"plot":"After his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry has spent two weeks mourning the loss of his godfather, Sirius Black. As Albus Dumbledore escorts him to the Weasley home, they visit the retired Hogwarts professor Horace Slughorn, who agrees to resume teaching. Meanwhile, Bellatrix Lestrange and her sister Narcissa Malfoy convince Severus Snape to make an Unbreakable Vow to protect Narcissa's son Draco at Hogwarts.While out shopping for school supplies, Harry, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger observe Draco making inquiries at Borgin and Burkes, a shop known for its connection to the Dark Arts. At Hogwarts, the students learn that Slughorn will be teaching Potions, while Snape will be taking over Defence Against the Dark Arts. For Slughorn's first class, Harry and Ron borrow a pair of old textbooks. Harry's textbook previously belonged to someone known as \"The Half-Blood Prince\", and it contains many helpful tips. Following the instructions of the Prince, Harry becomes an expert potion brewer. He rises to the top of the class and wins a vial of the luck potion Felix Felicis.Dumbledore prepares Harry for his eventual battle with Voldemort by educating him about Voldemort's past as Tom Riddle. While a student at Hogwarts, Riddle had asked Slughorn about objects called Horcruxes, which can grant immortality by encasing fragments of a wizard's soul. Dumbledore wants to see the memory as it appears in Slughorn's mind, and asks Harry to retrieve it from him. Harry joins the Slug Club, a group of Slughorn's famous, talented and well-connected students. Hermione and Ginny also attend the club, which causes Ron to feel left out. He accepts an invitation from Hermione to Slughorn's Christmas party, but upsets her when he kisses Lavender Brown. Meanwhile, Harry develops a crush on Ginny.When Ron is poisoned and admitted to the infirmary, Hermione visits him. Harry discards his Potions textbook after he nearly kills Draco with one of the Prince's scribbled spells. Later, Harry's luck potion helps him obtain Slughorn's memory and causes Lavender to break up with Ron, and Ginny to break up with her boyfriend Dean Thomas, which allows Harry to start seeing her instead. Slughorn's memory suggests that Voldemort created six Horcruxes, though Dumbledore explains that two are already destroyed: his diary and a ring his grandfather owned. He asks Harry to accompany him to retrieve another.In a remote cave, Harry and Dumbledore overcome many obstacles before seizing the Horcrux, the locket of Hogwarts founder, Salazar Slytherin. Back at Hogwarts, Dumbledore unexpectedly immobilizes Harry under his invisibility cloak. A group of Death Eaters arrives with Draco, who falters in an attempt to kill Dumbledore. Snape then casts the killing curse on Dumbledore and sends him falling to his death. Harry tries to fight Snape as he flees, but is overpowered. Snape reveals himself as the Half-Blood Prince and brags about creating the spells Harry is using. After Snape escapes, Harry discovers that the Horcrux he obtained is fake. He resolves to find and destroy all the remaining Horcruxes, and Ron and Hermione pledge to join him.Series\n[edit]Main article: Harry Potter seriesHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the sixth novel in the Harry Potter series.[3] The first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was originally published by Bloomsbury in 1997. Philosopher's Stone was followed by Chamber of Secrets (1998), Prisoner of Azkaban (1999), Goblet of Fire (2000), and Order of the Phoenix (2003).[a]Half-Blood Prince was followed by the final novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Half-Blood Prince sold 9 million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide release.[b]Background\n[edit]Rowling stated that she had Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince \"planned for years,\" but she spent two months revisiting her plan before she began writing the story's first draft. This was a lesson learned after she did not check the plan for Goblet of Fire and had to rewrite an entire third of the book.[16] She started writing the book before her second child, David, was born, but she took a break to care for him.[17] The first chapter, \"The Other Minister\", which features meetings between the Muggle Prime Minister, Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, and his successor, Rufus Scrimgeour, was a concept Rowling tried to start in Philosopher's Stone, Prisoner of Azkaban, and Order of the Phoenix, but she found \"it finally works\" in Half-Blood Prince.[18] She stated that she was \"seriously upset\" writing the end of the book, although Goblet of Fire was the hardest to write.[19] When asked if she liked the book, she responded, \"I like it better than I liked Goblet, Phoenix or Chamber when I finished them. Book six does what I wanted it to do and even if nobody else likes it (and some won't), I know it will remain one of my favourites of the series. Ultimately you have to please yourself before you please anyone else!\"[20]Rowling revealed the title of Half-Blood Prince on her website on 24 June 2004.[21] This was the title she had once considered for the second book, Chamber of Secrets, though she decided the information disclosed belonged later on in the story.[22] On 21 December 2004, she announced she had finished writing it, along with the release date of 16 July.[23][24] Bloomsbury unveiled the cover on 8 March 2005.[25]The record-breaking publication of Half-Blood Prince was accompanied by controversy. In May 2005, bookmakers in the UK suspended bets on which main character would die in the book amid fears of insider knowledge. A number of high-value bets were made on the death of Albus Dumbledore, many coming from the town of Bungay where it was believed the books were being printed at the time. Betting was later reopened.[26] Additionally, in response to Greenpeace's campaign on using forest-friendly paper for big-name authors, Bloomsbury published the book on 30% recycled paper.[27]Right-to-read controversy\n[edit]In early July 2005, a Real Canadian Superstore in Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada, accidentally sold fourteen copies of The Half-Blood Prince before the authorised release date. The Canadian publisher, Raincoast Books, obtained an injunction from the Supreme Court of British Columbia that prohibited the purchasers from reading the books before the official release date or discussing the contents.[28] Purchasers were offered Harry Potter T-shirts and autographed copies of the book if they returned their copies before 16 July.[28]On 15 July, less than twelve hours before the book went on sale in the Eastern time zone, Raincoast warned The Globe and Mail newspaper that publishing a review from a Canada-based writer at midnight, as the paper had promised, would be seen as a violation of the trade secret injunction. The injunction sparked a number of news articles alleging that the injunction had restricted fundamental rights. Canadian law professor Michael Geist posted commentary on his blog.[29]Richard Stallman called for a boycott and requested the publisher issue an apology.[30]The Globe and Mail published a review from two UK-based writers in its 16 July edition and posted the Canadian writer's review on its website at 9:00 that morning.[31] Commentary was also provided on the Raincoast website.[32]Some reviewers noted that Half-Blood Prince contained a darker tone than the previous Potter novels. The Christian Science Monitor's reviewer Yvonne Zipp argued the first half contained a lighter tone to soften the unhappy ending.[33]The Boston Globe reviewer Liz Rosenberg wrote, \"lightness [is] slimmer than ever in this darkening series...[there is] a new charge of gloom and darkness. I felt depressed by the time I was two-thirds of the way through.\" She also compared the setting to Charles Dickens's depictions of London as it was \"brooding, broken, gold-lit, as living a character as any other.\"[34]Christopher Paolini called the darker tone \"disquieting\" because it was so different from the earlier books.[35] Liesl Schillinger, a contributor to The New York Times book review, also noted that Half-Blood Prince was \"far darker\" but \"leavened with humor, romance and snappy dialogue.\" She suggested a connection to the 11 September attacks, as the later, darker novels were written after that event.[36] David Kipen, a critic of the San Francisco Chronicle, considered the \"darkness as a sign of our paranoid times\" and singled out curfews and searches that were part of the tightened security at Hogwarts as resemblances to our world.[37]Julia Keller, a critic for the Chicago Tribune, highlighted the humour found in the novel and claimed it to be the success of the Harry Potter saga. She acknowledged that \"the books are dark and scary in places\" but \"no darkness in Half-Blood Prince...is so immense that it cannot be rescued by a snicker or a smirk.\" She considered that Rowling was suggesting difficult times can be worked through with imagination, hope, and humour and compared this concept to works such as Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time and Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows.[38]Rosenberg wrote that the two main themes of Half-Blood Prince were love and death and praised Rowling's \"affirmation of their central position in human lives.\" She considered love to be represented in several forms: the love of parent to child, teacher to student, and the romances that developed between the main characters.[34] Zipp noted trust and redemption to be themes promising to continue in the final book, which she thought \"would add a greater layer of nuance and complexity to some characters who could sorely use it.\"[33] Deepti Hajela also pointed out Harry's character development, that he was \"no longer a boy wizard; he's a young man, determined to seek out and face a young man's challenges.\"[39] Paolini had similar views, claiming, \"the children have changed...they act like real teenagers.\"[35]Critical reception\n[edit]Liesl Schillinger of The New York Times praised the novel's various themes and suspenseful ending. However, she considered Rowling's gift \"not so much for language as for characterisation and plotting.\"[36]Kirkus Reviews said it \"will leave readers pleased, amused, excited, scared, infuriated, delighted, sad, surprised, thoughtful and likely wondering where Voldemort has got to, since he appears only in flashbacks.\" They considered Rowling's \"wry wit\" to turn into \"outright merriment\" but called the climax \"tragic, but not uncomfortably shocking.\"[40] Yvonne Zipp of The Christian Science Monitor praised the way Rowling evolved Harry into a teenager and how the plot threads found as far back as Chamber of Secrets came into play. On the other hand, she noted it \"gets a little exposition-heavy in spots,\" and older readers may have seen the ending coming.[33]The Boston Globe correspondent Liz Rosenberg wrote, \"The book bears the mark of genius on every page\" and praised the imagery and darker tone of the book, considering that the series could be crossing over from fantasy to horror.[34] The Associated Press writer Deepti Hajela praised the newfound emotional tones and ageing Harry to the point at which \"younger fans may find [the series] has grown up too much.\"[39] Emily Green, a staff writer for the Los Angeles Times, was generally positive about the book but was concerned whether young children could handle the material.[41] Cultural critic Julia Keller of the Chicago Tribune called it the \"most eloquent and substantial addition to the series thus far\" and considered the key to the success of the Potter novels to be humour.[38]Awards and honours\n[edit]Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince won several awards, including the 2006 British Book of the Year Award[42] and the 2006 Royal Mail Award for Scottish Children's Books for ages 8–12 in its native United Kingdom.[43] In the United States, the American Library Association listed it among its 2006 Best Books for Young Adults.[44] It won both the 2005 reader-voted Quill Awards for Best Book of the Year and Best Children's Book.[45][46] It also won the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Seal for notable book.[47]Sales\n[edit]Before publication, 1.4 million pre-orders were placed for Half-Blood Prince on Amazon.com, breaking the record held by the previous novel, Order of the Phoenix, with 1.3 million.[48] The initial print run for Half-Blood Prince was a record-breaking 10.8 million.[49] Within the first 24 hours after release, the book sold 9 million copies worldwide: 2 million in the UK and about 6.9 million in the US,[50] which prompted Scholastic to rush an additional 2.7 million copies into print.[51] Within the first nine weeks of publication, 11 million copies of the US edition were reported to have been sold.[52] The US audiobook, read by Jim Dale, set sales records with 165,000 sold over two days, besting the adaptation of Order of the Phoenix by twenty percent.[53]See also: Harry Potter in translationHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was published simultaneously in the UK, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.[54] Along with the rest of the books in the Harry Potter series, it was eventually translated into 67 languages.[55] However, because of high security surrounding the manuscript, translators did not get to start on translating Half-Blood Prince until its English release date, and the earliest were not expected to be released until the fall of 2005.[56] In Germany, a group of \"hobby translators\" translated the book via the internet less than two days after release, long before German translator Klaus Fritz could translate and publish the book.[57]Since its wide hardcover release on 16 July 2005, Half-Blood Prince was released as a paperback on 23 June 2006 in the UK.[58] Two days later on 25 July, the paperback edition was released in Canada[59] and the US, where it had an initial print run of 2 million copies.[60] To celebrate the release of the American paperback edition, Scholastic held a six-week sweepstakes event in which participants in an online poll were entered to win prizes.[61] Simultaneous to the original hardcover release was the UK adult edition that featured a new cover[62] and was also released as a paperback on 23 June.[63] Also released on 16 July was the Scholastic \"Deluxe Edition,\" which featured reproductions of Mary GrandPré's artwork and had a print run of about 100,000 copies.[64] Bloomsbury later released a paperback \"Special Edition\" on 6 July 2009[65] and a \"Signature Edition\" paperback on 1 November 2010.[66]Film\n[edit]Main article: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)The film adaptation of the sixth book was originally scheduled to be released on 21 November 2008 but was changed to 15 July 2009.[67][68] Directed by David Yates, the screenplay was adapted by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman and David Barron.[69] The film grossed over $934 million worldwide,[70] which made it the second-highest-grossing film of 2009 worldwide[71] and the fifteenth-highest of all time.[72] Additionally, Half-Blood Prince gained an Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography.[73][74]Video games\n[edit]Main article: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)A video game adaptation of the book was developed by EA Bright Light Studio and published by Electronic Arts in 2009. The game was available on the Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Wii, Xbox 360, and macOS platforms.The book was also adapted in the 2011 video game Lego Harry Potter: Years 5–7.^ Attributed to multiple references:[4][5][6]\n^ Attributed to multiple references:[7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15]^ \"11 Million Copies of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Sold in First Nine Weeks\".

{"title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows","author":"J. K. Rowling","published":2007,"fiction":true,"plot":"The young wizard Harry Potter is about to turn seventeen and therefore lose the protective magic shield his mother's sacrifice gave him. He is being escorted to The Burrow by members of the Order of the Phoenix when the group is attacked by Death Eaters. Hedwig and \"Mad-Eye\" Moody are killed and George Weasley loses an ear. Lord Voldemort attempts to kill Harry but fails.Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger begin searching for Voldemort's four remaining Horcruxes. They learn that the locket Horcrux is in the possession of Dolores Umbridge at the Ministry of Magic. Harry and his friends infiltrate the Ministry and steal the locket from Umbridge, but are unable to destroy it. The locket's Dark magic affects Ron, who abandons Harry and Hermione. In Godric's Hollow, Harry and Hermione are attacked by Voldemort's snake Nagini, but manage to escape. One night, a Patronus guides Harry to a pond containing the Sword of Gryffindor. When he tries to recover it, the locket tightens around his neck, nearly drowning him. Ron returns and saves Harry, then destroys the Horcrux with the sword.The three friends visit Xenophilius Lovegood, who tells them of the mythical objects known as the Deathly Hallows: the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Cloak of Invisibility. Xenophilius then alerts the Ministry of Magic to the presence of the trio in his home, but Harry and his friends escape. Soon after, they are captured by Snatchers, bounty hunters hired by Voldemort, and imprisoned in Malfoy Manor. Harry and Ron are thrown into the cellar with Dean Thomas, Luna Lovegood, Mr Ollivander and Griphook the goblin, while the Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange tortures Hermione for information. The house-elf Dobby helps all seven prisoners escape, but is killed in the process.After a brief stay at Bill and Fleur's cottage, Harry, Ron and Hermione break into Gringotts Bank and retrieve another Horcrux from the vault of Bellatrix Lestrange. Harry has visions which inform him that another Horcrux is hidden at Hogwarts. After the trio enters the school with the help of Aberforth Dumbledore, Voldemort prepares to assault the castle. As the Death Eaters enter the school and fight the professors and students, Ron and Hermione destroy the Horcrux from Gringotts. They then accompany Harry to the Room of Requirement, where they discover the next Horcrux which is the Diadem of Ravenclaw. Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle ambush them, and Crabbe casts a powerful fire spell which grows out of his control and kills both him and the Horcrux.After stealing the Elder Wand from Albus Dumbledore's tomb, Voldemort is unable to make it obey him. Believing that Severus Snape is the master of the wand, Voldemort uses Nagini to mortally wound him, seemingly transferring ownership of the wand to Voldemort. Before dying, Snape passes his memories to Harry, who views them in the Pensieve. The memories reveal that Snape and Harry's mother were childhood friends. Snape was in love with her, and acted as a double agent against Voldemort in an attempt to protect her. Dumbledore had learned he was dying, and decided to plan his own death at the hands of Snape so that Snape could gain Voldemort's trust. The memories also reveal that Harry himself accidentally became a Horcrux when Voldemort first tried to kill him. Now, Harry must die to render Voldemort mortal. On his way to surrender himself to Voldemort, Harry instructs Neville Longbottom to destroy Voldemort's final Horcrux, Nagini. He also uses the Resurrection Stone to communicate with four deceased loved ones: his parents, Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin, one last time.Voldemort casts the Killing Curse on Harry, who then awakens in a dreamlike version of King's Cross Station. He is greeted by Dumbledore, who explains that the curse destroyed the fragment of Voldemort's soul inside Harry, and that Harry can now return to life. Harry subsequently regains consciousness and pretends to be dead. Voldemort orders Hagrid to carry Harry's body back to Hogwarts, and demands that the professors and students surrender. Neville, however, pulls the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat and kills Nagini, Voldemort's last Horcrux, rendering him mortal. The battle resumes, during which Molly Weasley kills Bellatrix. Harry reveals himself to be alive and duels with Voldemort, who casts another Killing Curse. However, the Elder Wand refuses to kill Harry, because Harry is its true master: Draco disarmed Dumbledore, the original owner, and Harry later disarmed Draco, transferring ownership to himself. This causes Voldemort's spell to rebound and kill him. Harry then uses the Elder Wand to fix his original wand and returns it to Dumbledore's tomb.In the novel's epilogue, set nineteen years later, Harry and his friends see their children off to Hogwarts. Harry and Ginny, now married, have three children: James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna. Ron and Hermione have a daughter named Rose and a son named Hugo.[3]Series\n[edit]The first novel in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published by Bloomsbury in 1997.[4] It was followed by Chamber of Secrets (1998), Prisoner of Azkaban (1999), Goblet of Fire (2000), Order of the Phoenix (2003) and Half-Blood Prince (2005).[a]Title\n[edit]The title of the novel refers to three mythical objects featured in the story, which are collectively known as the \"Deathly Hallows\". Rowling announced the title in December 2006 through a Christmas-themed hangman puzzle on her website.[10] Other titles that Rowling considered were Harry Potter and the Elder Wand and Harry Potter and the Peverell Quest.[11][12]Writing\n[edit]Rowling completed the novel in January 2007 while staying at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh.[13] In a statement on her website, she said, \"I've never felt such a mixture of extreme emotions in my life, never dreamed I could feel simultaneously heartbroken and euphoric.\" She compared her mixed feelings to those expressed by Charles Dickens in the preface of the 1850 edition of David Copperfield, \"a two-years' imaginative task\". \"To which,\" she added, \"I can only sigh, try seventeen years, Charles\". She ended her message by saying \"Deathly Hallows is my favourite, and that is the most wonderful way to finish the series\".[14]When asked before publication about the forthcoming book, Rowling stated that she could not change the ending even if she wanted. \"These books have been plotted for such a long time, and for six books now, that they're all leading a certain direction. So, I really can't\".[15] She also commented that the final volume related closely to the previous book in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, \"almost as though they are two-halves of the same novel\".[16] She said the last chapter of Deathly Hallows was written around 1990 as part of her earliest work on the series.[17] She also revealed that the last sentence was originally something akin to \"Only those who he loved could see his lightning scar\". She changed the sentence to \"All was well\" because she wanted it to be clear that Harry had triumphed over Voldemort and that he would not have to face him again.[18][19]See also: Harry Potter fandomMarketing and promotion\n[edit]The launch of Deathly Hallows was celebrated by an all-night book signing and reading by Rowling at the Natural History Museum in London. The 1,700 guests in attendance were chosen by ballot.[20] Rowling toured the United States in October 2007, where another event was held at Carnegie Hall in New York City with tickets allocated by sweepstake.[21]Scholastic, the American publisher of the Harry Potter series, launched a multimillion-dollar \"There will soon be 7\" marketing campaign with a Knight Bus travelling to 40 libraries across the United States, online fan discussions and competitions, collectible bookmarks, tattoos, and the staged release of seven Deathly Hallows questions most debated by fans.[22][23]Rowling arranged with her publishers for a poster bearing the face of the missing British child Madeleine McCann to be made available to book sellers when Deathly Hallows was launched on 21 July 2007, and said that she hoped that the posters would be displayed prominently in shops all over the world.[24]After it was announced that the novel would be released on 21 July 2007, Warner Bros. stated that the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix would be released on 13 July.[25] In response, fans proclaimed July 2007 as the month of Harry Potter.[26]Spoiler embargo\n[edit]Bloomsbury invested £10 million in an attempt to keep the book's contents secure until 21 July, the release date.[27] Arthur Levine, US editor of the Harry Potter series, denied distributing any copies of Deathly Hallows in advance for press review, but two US papers published early reviews anyway.[28] There was speculation that some shops would break the embargo and distribute copies of the book early, as the penalty imposed for previous instalments—that the distributor would not be supplied with any further copies of the series—would no longer be a deterrent.[29]Online leaks and early delivery\n[edit]In the week before its release, a number of texts purporting to be genuine leaks appeared in various forms. On 16 July, a set of photographs representing all 759 pages of the US edition was leaked and was fully transcribed prior to the official release date.[30][31][32][33] The photographs later appeared on websites and peer-to-peer networks, leading Scholastic to seek a subpoena in order to identify one source.[34] This represented the most serious security breach in the Harry Potter series' history.[35] Rowling and her lawyer confirmed that there were genuine online leaks.[19][36] Reviews published in both The Baltimore Sun and The New York Times on 18 July 2007, corroborated many of the plot elements from this leak, and about one day prior to release, The New York Times confirmed that the main circulating leak was real.[35]Scholastic announced that approximately one-ten-thousandth (0.0001) of the US supply had been shipped early — interpreted to mean about 1,200 copies. One reader in Maryland received a copy of the book in the mail from DeepDiscount.com four days before it was launched, which evoked incredulous responses from both Scholastic and DeepDiscount. Scholastic initially reported that they were satisfied it had been a \"human error\" and would not discuss possible penalties;[37] however, the following day Scholastic announced that it would be launching legal action against DeepDiscount.com and its distributor, Levy Home Entertainment.[38] Scholastic filed for damages in Chicago's Circuit Court of Cook County, claiming that DeepDiscount engaged in a \"complete and flagrant violation of the agreements that they knew were part of the carefully constructed release of this eagerly awaited book.\"[39] Some of the early-release books soon appeared on eBay, in one case being sold to Publishers Weekly for US$250 from an initial price of US$18.[40]Price wars and other controversies\n[edit]Asda,[41][42] along with several other UK supermarkets, having already taken pre-orders for the book at a heavily discounted price, sparked a price war two days before the book's launch by announcing they would sell it for just £5 a copy. Other retail chains then also offered the book at discounted prices. At these prices the book became a loss leader. This caused uproar from traditional UK booksellers who argued they had no hope of competing in those conditions. Independent shops protested loudest, but even Waterstone's, the UK's largest dedicated chain bookstore, could not compete with the supermarket price. Some small bookstores hit back by buying their stock from the supermarkets rather than their wholesalers. Asda attempted to counter this by imposing a limit of two copies per customer to prevent bulk purchases. Philip Wicks, a spokesman for the UK Booksellers Association, said, \"It is a war we can't even participate in. We think it's a crying shame that the supermarkets have decided to treat it as a loss-leader, like a can of baked beans.\" Michael Norris, an analyst at Simba Information, said: \"You are not only lowering the price of the book. At this point, you are lowering the value of reading.\"[43]In Malaysia, a similar price war caused controversy regarding sales of the book.[44] Four of the biggest bookstore chains in Malaysia, MPH Bookstores, Popular Bookstores, Times and Harris, decided to pull Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows off their shelves as a protest against Tesco and Carrefour hypermarkets. The retail price of the book in Malaysia was MYR 109.90, while the hypermarkets Tesco and Carrefour sold the book at MYR 69.90. The move by the bookstores was seen as an attempt to pressure the distributor Penguin Books to remove the books from the hypermarkets. However, as of 24 July 2007, the price war had ended, with the four bookstores involved resuming selling the books in their stores with discount. Penguin Books has also confirmed that Tesco and Carrefour were selling the book at a loss, urging them to practise good business sense and fair trade.[45]The book's early Saturday morning release in Israel was criticised for violating Shabbat. Trade and Industry Minister Eli Yishai commented \"It is forbidden, according to Jewish values and Jewish culture, that a thing like this should take place at 2 am on Saturday. Let them do it on another day.\"[46] Yishai indicated that he would issue indictments and fines based on the Hours of Work and Rest Law.[47]Editions\n[edit]Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released in hardcover on 21 July 2007[48] and in paperback in the United Kingdom on 10 July 2008[49] and the United States on 7 July 2009.[50] In SoHo, New York, there was a release party for the American paperback edition, with many games and activities.[51] An \"Adult Edition\" with a different cover illustration was released by Bloomsbury on 21 July 2007.[52] To be released simultaneously with the original US hardcover on 21 July with only 100,000 copies was a Scholastic deluxe edition, highlighting a new cover illustration by Mary GrandPré.[53] In October 2010, Bloomsbury released a \"Celebratory\" paperback edition, which featured a foiled and starred cover.[54] Lastly, on 1 November 2010, a \"Signature\" edition of the novel was released in paperback by Bloomsbury.[55]Translations\n[edit]Main article: Harry Potter in translationAs with previous books in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows has been translated into many languages. The first translation to be released was the Ukrainian translation, on 25 September 2007 (as Гаррі Поттер і смертельні реліквії – Harry Potter i smertel'ni relikviji).[56] The Swedish title of the book was revealed by Rowling as Harry Potter and the Relics of Death (Harry Potter och Dödsrelikerna), following a pre-release question from the Swedish publisher about the difficulty of translating the two words \"Deathly Hallows\" without having read the book.[57] This is also the title used for the French translation (Harry Potter et les reliques de la mort), the Spanish translation (Harry Potter y las Reliquias de la Muerte), the Dutch translation (Harry Potter en de Relieken van de Dood), the Serbian translation (Хари Потер и реликвије смрти – Hari Poter i relikvije smrti) and the Brazilian Portuguese translation (Harry Potter e as Relíquias da Morte).[58] The first Polish translation was released with a new title: Harry Potter i Insygnia Śmierci – Harry Potter and the Insignia of Death.[59] The Hindi translation Harry Potter aur Maut ke Tohfe (हैरी पॉटर और मौत के तोहफे), which means \"Harry Potter and the Gifts of Death\", was released by Manjul Publication in India on 27 June 2008.[60] The Romanian version was released on 1 December 2007 using the title (Harry Potter și Talismanele Morții).Critical response\n[edit]The Baltimore Sun's critic, Mary Carole McCauley, noted that the book was more serious than the previous novels in the series and had more straightforward prose.[61] Furthermore, reviewer Alice Fordham from The Times wrote that \"Rowling's genius is not just her total realisation of a fantasy world, but the quieter skill of creating characters that bounce off the page, real and flawed and brave and lovable\". Fordham concluded, \"We have been a long way together, and neither Rowling nor Harry let us down in the end\".[62]The New York Times writer Michiko Kakutani agreed, praising Rowling's ability to make Harry both a hero and a character that can be related to.[63]Time magazine's Lev Grossman named it one of the Top 10 Fiction Books of 2007, ranking it at No. 8, and praised Rowling for proving that books can still be a global mass medium.[64] Novelist Elizabeth Hand criticised that \"... the spectacularly complex interplay of narrative and character often reads as though an entire trilogy's worth of summing-up has been crammed into one volume.\"[65] In a starred review from Kirkus Reviews, the reviewer said, \"Rowling has shown uncommon skill in playing them with and against each other, and also woven them into a darn good bildungsroman, populated by memorable characters and infused with a saving, irrepressible sense of fun\". They also praised the second half of the novel, but criticised the epilogue, calling it \"provocatively sketchy\".[66] In another review from The Times, reviewer Amanda Craig said that while Rowling was \"not an original, high-concept author\", she was \"right up there with other greats of children's fiction\". Craig went on to say that the novel was \"beautifully judged, and a triumphant return to form\", and that Rowling's imagination changed the perception of an entire generation, which \"is more than all but a handful of living authors, in any genre, have achieved in the past half-century\".[67]In contrast, Jenny Sawyer of The Christian Science Monitor said that, \"There is much to love about the Harry Potter series, from its brilliantly realised magical world to its multilayered narrative\", however, \"A story is about someone who changes. And, puberty aside, Harry doesn't change much. As envisioned by Rowling, he walks the path of good so unwaveringly that his final victory over Voldemort feels, not just inevitable, but hollow\".[68] In The New York Times, Christopher Hitchens compared the series to World War Two-era English boarding school stories, and while he wrote that \"Rowling has won imperishable renown\" for the series as a whole, he also stated that he disliked Rowling's use of deus ex machina, that the mid-book camping chapters are \"abysmally long\", and Voldemort \"becomes more tiresome than an Ian Fleming villain\".[69] Catherine Bennett of The Guardian praised Rowling for putting small details from the previous books and making them large in Deathly Hallows, such as Grindelwald being mentioned on a Chocolate Frog Card in the first book. While she points out \"as her critics say, Rowling is no Dickens\", she says that Rowling \"has willed into a fictional being, in every book, legions of new characters, places, spells, rules and scores of unimagined twists and subplots\".[70]Stephen King criticised the reactions of some reviewers to the books, including McCauley, for jumping too quickly to surface conclusions of the work.[71] He felt this was inevitable, because of the extreme secrecy before launch which did not allow reviewers time to read and consider the book, but meant that many early reviews lacked depth. Rather than finding the writing style disappointing, he felt it had matured and improved. He acknowledged that the subject matter of the books had become more adult, and that Rowling had clearly been writing with the adult audience firmly in mind since the middle of the series. He compared the works in this respect to Huckleberry Finn and Alice in Wonderland which achieved success and have become established classics, in part by appealing to the adult audience as well as children.[71]Sales\n[edit]Sales for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows were record-setting. The initial US print run for Deathly Hallows was 12 million copies, and more than a million were pre-ordered through Amazon and Barnes & Noble,[72] 500 per cent higher than pre-sales had been for Half-Blood Prince.[73] On 12 April 2007, Barnes & Noble declared that Deathly Hallows had broken its pre-order record, with more than 500,000 copies pre-ordered through its site.[74] On opening day, a record 8.3 million copies were sold in the United States (over 96 per second),[75][76] and 2.65 million copies in the United Kingdom.[77] It holds the Guinness World record for fastest selling book of fiction in 24 hours for US sales.[2] At WH Smith, sales reportedly reached a rate of 15 books sold per second.[78] By June 2008, nearly a year after it was published, worldwide sales were reportedly around 44 million.[79]Awards and honours\n[edit]Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows has won several awards.[80] In 2007, the book was named one of The New York Times 100 Notable Books,[81] and one of its Notable Children's Books.[82] The novel was named the best book of 2007, by Newsweek's critic Malcolm Jones.[83]Publishers Weekly also listed Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows among their Best Books of 2007.[84] Also in 2007 the book received the Andre Norton Award for Young Adult Science Fiction and Fantasy at the Nebula Awards. In 2008, the American Library Association named the novel one of its Best Books for Young Adults,[85] and also listed it as a Notable Children's Book.[86] Furthermore, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows received the 2008 Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award.[80]Death\n[edit]In a 2006 interview, Rowling said that the main theme of the series is Harry dealing with death,[87] which was influenced by her mother's death in 1990.[b]Lev Grossman of Time asserted that the main theme of the series is the importance of continuing to love in the face of death.[64]Living in a corrupted society\n[edit]Academics and journalists have developed many other interpretations of themes in the books, some more complex than others, and some including political subtexts. Themes such as normality, oppression, survival, and overcoming imposing odds have all been considered as prevalent throughout the series.[90] Similarly, the theme of making one's way through adolescence and \"going over one's most harrowing ordeals—and thus coming to terms with them\" has also been considered.[91] Rowling has stated that the books comprise \"a prolonged argument for tolerance, a prolonged plea for an end to bigotry\" and that also pass on a message to \"question authority and ... not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth\".[92]Timothy Snyder in his 2017 book On Tyranny mentioned the novel as a recent example illustrating resistance to totalitarianism.[93][94]Christian allegories\n[edit]See also: Religious debates over the Harry Potter series § Christian allegories in Deathly HallowsThe Harry Potter series has been criticised for supposedly supporting witchcraft and the occult. Before publication of Deathly Hallows, Rowling refused to speak out about her religion, stating, \"If I talk too freely, every reader, whether 10 or 60, will be able to guess what's coming in the books\".[95] However, many have commented on Christian allegories that appear in Deathly Hallows.[95] For example, Harry dies and then comes back to life to save mankind, like Christ. The location where this occurs is King's Cross.[96] Rowling also stated that \"my belief and my struggling with religious belief ... I think is quite apparent in this book\", which is shown as Harry struggles with his faith in Dumbledore.[97]Deathly Hallows begins with a pair of epigraphs, one by Quaker leader William Penn and one from Aeschylus' The Libation Bearers. Of this, Rowling said \"I really enjoyed choosing those two quotations because one is pagan, of course, and one is from a Christian tradition. I'd known it was going to be those two passages since Chamber was published. I always knew [that] if I could use them at the beginning of book seven then I'd cued up the ending perfectly. If they were relevant, then I went where I needed to go. They just say it all to me, they really do\".[98]When Harry visits his parents' grave, the biblical reference \"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death\" (1 Corinthians 15:26) is inscribed on the grave.[99] The Dumbledores' family tomb also holds a biblical quote: \"Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also\", which is from Matthew 6:21.[99] Rowling states, \"They're very British books, so on a very practical note Harry was going to find biblical quotations on tombstones ... [but] I think those two particular quotations he finds on the tombstones at Godric's Hollow, they sum up – they almost epitomise the whole series\".[99]Harry Potter pundit John Granger additionally noted that one of the reasons the Harry Potter books were so popular is their use of literary alchemy (similar to Romeo and Juliet, C. S. Lewis's Perelandra and Charles Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities) and vision symbolism.[100] In this model, authors weave allegorical tales along the alchemical magnum opus. Since the medieval period, alchemical allegory has mirrored the passion, death and resurrection of Christ.[101] While the entire series utilises symbols common in alchemy, the Deathly Hallows completes this cycle, tying themes of death, rebirth, and the Resurrection Stone to the principal motif of alchemical allegory, and topics presented in the first book of the series.Films\n[edit]Main articles: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2The two-part film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was directed by David Yates, written by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman, David Barron, and J. K. Rowling. Part 1 was released on 19 November 2010, and Part 2 on 15 July 2011.[102][103] Filming began in February 2009, and ended on 12 June 2010.[104] However, the cast confirmed they would reshoot the epilogue scene as they only had two days to shoot the original.[citation needed][105]Part 1 ended at Chapter 24 of the book, when Voldemort regained the Elder Wand.[106] However, there were a few omissions, such as the appearances of Dean Thomas and Viktor Krum, and Peter Pettigrew's death.[107] James Bernadelli of Reelviews said that the script stuck closest to the text since Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,[108] yet this was met with negativity from some audiences as the film inherited \"the book's own problems\".[109]Audiobooks\n[edit]Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released simultaneously on 21 July 2007, in both the UK and the United States.[110][111] The UK edition features the voice of Stephen Fry and runs about 24 hours[112] while the US edition features the voice of Jim Dale and runs about 21 hours.[113] Both Fry and Dale recorded 146 different and distinguishable character voices, and was the most recorded by an individual on an audiobook at the time.[114]For his work on Deathly Hallows, Dale won the 2008 Grammy Award for the Best Spoken Word Album for Children.[115] He also was awarded an Earphone Award by AudioFile, who claimed, \"Dale has raised the bar on audiobook interpretation so high it's hard to imagine any narrator vaulting over it.\"[116]Video games\n[edit]Two action-adventure video games were produced by Electronic Arts (EA) to coincide with the release of the film adaptations, as with each of the previous Harry Potter films. Part 1 was released on 16 November 2010, and Part 2 on 12 July 2011. Both games received a mixed to negative reaction from critics.[117][118]The Tales of Beedle the Bard\n[edit]On 4 December 2008, Rowling released The Tales of Beedle the Bard both in the UK and US.[119]The Tales of Beedle the Bard is a spin-off of Deathly Hallows and contains fairy tales that are told to children in the \"Wizarding World\". The book includes five short stories, including \"The Tale of the Three Brothers\" which is the story of the Deathly Hallows.Amazon released an exclusive collector's edition of the book which is a replica of the book that Amazon purchased at auction in December 2007.[120] Seven copies were auctioned off in London by Sotheby's. Each was illustrated and handwritten by Rowling and is 157 pages. It was bound in brown Moroccan leather and embellished with five hand-chased hallmarked sterling silver ornaments and mounted moonstones.[121]Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\n[edit]In 2016, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was released, a two-part play written by Jack Thorne based on an original story by Rowling, Thorne, and John Tiffany.[122] Billed as the eighth story in the Harry Potter series, it picks up where the epilogue of Deathly Hallows left off, following an adult Harry Potter and his son, Albus Severus Potter.[123] Previews of the play began at the Palace Theatre, London, on 7 June 2016,[124] and it premiered on 30 July 2016. The play opened on Broadway on 21 April 2018 at the Lyric Theatre, with previews starting on 16 March 2018.Both parts of the stage play's script have been released in print and digital formats as Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Parts I & II. The first edition, the Special Rehearsal Edition, corresponded to the script used in the preview shows and was published on 31 July 2016, the date of Harry's birthday in the series and Rowling's birthday, as well. Since revisions to the script continued after the book was printed, an edited version was released on 25 July 2017, as the \"Definitive Collector's Edition\".[citation needed] According to CNN, this was the most preordered book of 2016.[125]^ Attributed to multiple references:[5][6][7][8][9]\n^ Attributed to multiple references:[18][87][88][89]^ Rich, Motoko (22 July 2007). \"Record First-Day Sales for Last 'Harry Potter' Book\".

{"title":"The Alchemist","author":"Paulo Coelho","published":1988,"fiction":true,"plot":"An Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago dreams of a treasure while in a ruined church. He consults a Gypsy fortune-teller about the meaning of the recurring dream. The woman interprets it as a prophecy, telling the boy that he will discover a treasure at the Egyptian pyramids.After Santiago sets out, he meets Melchizedek, the king of Salem, who tells him to sell his sheep so as to travel to Egypt and accomplish his \"Personal Legend\". Early on his arrival in Africa, a man who claims to be able to take Santiago to the pyramids instead robs him of the money he had made from his flock. Santiago then has to work for a crystal merchant to earn enough to continue his journey.Along the way, the boy meets an Englishman who has come in search of an alchemist who can turn any metal to gold, and continues his travels with his new companion. When they reach an oasis, Santiago meets and falls in love with an Arabian girl named Fatima, to whom he proposes marriage. She promises to marry him only after he completes his journey. Frustrated at first, he later learns that true love will not stop nor must one sacrifice one's destiny to it, since to do so robs it of truth.The boy then encounters the wise alchemist, who teaches him to realize his true self. Together, they risk a journey through the territory of warring tribes, where Santiago is forced to demonstrate his oneness with the \"Soul of the World\" by turning himself into a dust storm before he is allowed to proceed.When he reaches the pyramids and begins digging, he is robbed by thieves, who ask him what he is digging for; he replies that a dream has led him to buried treasure. The thieves scoff, and the leader remarks about a dream he once had about treasure under a tree at a ruined church. Santiago realizes the treasure he sought was where he had his original dream all along.The plot of the novel builds on the international folktale type classified as no. 1645 (\"The Treasure at Home\") in the Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index of folktales: \"A man dreams that if he goes to a distant city he will find treasure on a certain bridge. Finding no treasure, he tells his dream to a man who says that he too has dreamed of treasure at certain place. He describes the place, which is the first man's home. When the latter returns home he finds the treasure.\"[1] The earliest known version of this tale type is a poem by the 13th-century Persian poet Rumi, and a variant of the tale appears in the One Thousand and One Nights collection of Arabic folktales.[2][3]The book's main theme is about finding one's destiny, although according to The New York Times, The Alchemist is \"more self-help than literature\".[4] The advice given to Santiago that \"when you really want something to happen, the whole universe will conspire so that your wish comes true\" is the core of the novel's thinking.[5] Coelho originally wrote The Alchemist in only two weeks, explaining later that he was able to work at this pace because the story was \"already written in [his] soul.\"[6]In 1994, a comic adaptation was published by Alexandre Jubran.[7] HarperOne, a HarperCollins imprint, produced an illustrated version of the novel, with paintings by the French artist Mœbius, but failed to convince Coelho \"to consent to the full graphic-novel treatment\".[8]The Alchemist: A Graphic Novel was published in 2010, adapted by Derek Ruiz and with artwork by Daniel Sampere.The Alchemist's Symphony by the young Walter Taieb was released in 1997 with the support of Paulo Coelho, who wrote an original text for the CD booklet.[9] The work has eight movements and five interludes.[10][11]In 2002, a theatrical adaptation of The Alchemist was produced and performed in London.[12] Since then there have been several productions by the Cornish Collective.[13] A later London performance was visited by the producer Ashvin Gidwani who, finding it \"verbose but colourful\", decided to commission a new 90-minute version of the book from Deepa Gahlot for the Indian stage.[14] This was eventually launched in 2009.[15]In 2006, Mistaken Identity, a Singapore indie rock band, adapted the story of the novel into what they claimed was \"essentially our attempt at writing a musical\" and released the track as \"The Alchemist\".[16]Kochavva Paulo Ayyappa Coelho, an Indian Malayalam-language film written and directed by Sidhartha Siva, has its title inspired by novelist Paulo Coelho, and a central theme is inspired from The Alchemist.[17][18]In 2024, Kadokawa Corporation announced that a manga adaptation illustrated by Tamaki Nakamura would be released under their new Kadokawa Masterpiece Comics label in November 2024.[19][20]Film adaptation\n[edit]In 2008, the Weinstein Company bought the film rights, but the project stalled after Weinstein scandal. In 2016, PalmStar Media acquired the film rights.[21] In 2023, Legendary Entertainment got the film, television, and ancillary rights to make a film adaptation with TriStar Pictures and Palmstar Media with Jack Thorne attached as a writer.[22]^ Antti Aarne, Stith Thompson.

{"title":"The Catcher in the Rye","author":"J. D. Salinger","published":1951,"fiction":true,"plot":"Holden Caulfield recalls the events of a long weekend, shortly before the previous year's Christmas. The story begins at Pencey Preparatory Academy, an elite boarding school in the fictional town of Agerstown, Pennsylvania, where he has been expelled after failing all his classes, except English.Later, Holden agrees to write an English composition for his roommate, Ward Stradlater, who is heading out on a date. He is distressed when he learns that Stradlater's date is Jane Gallagher, with whom Holden has been infatuated. When Stradlater returns, hours later, he fails to appreciate the deeply personal composition Holden has written for him about the baseball glove of Holden's late brother, Allie, who died from leukemia years earlier, and refuses to say whether he had sex with Jane. Enraged, Holden punches and insults him, but Stradlater easily wins the fight. Fed up with the \"phonies\" at Pencey Prep, Holden decides to catch a train to New York, planning to stay away from his home until Wednesday, when his parents will have received notification of his expulsion.Throughout the night, Holden has unpleasant encounters with a prostitute named Sunny, and her pimp, Maurice, who ends up in a physical altercation with Holden; a familiar date, Sally Hayes, who Holden invites to run away with him but is rejected; and an old classmate Carl Luce, who Holden unrelentingly questions about his sex life. Holden eventually gets drunk, awkwardly flirts with several adults, calls Sally again, and runs out of money.Nostalgic to see his younger sister Phoebe, Holden sneaks into his parents' apartment while they are out and wakes her. Though happy to see him, Phoebe quickly guesses he has been expelled and chastises him for his general aimlessness and disdain. When she asks if he cares about anything, Holden shares a fantasy (based on a mishearing of Robert Burns's Comin' Through the Rye), in which he imagines himself saving children running through a field of rye by catching them before they fall off a nearby cliff. Phoebe points out that the actual poem says, \"when a body meet a body, comin' through the rye.\" Holden breaks down in tears, and his sister tries to console him.As his parents return home, he slips out and visits his former English teacher, Mr. Antolini, who expresses concern that Holden is headed for \"a terrible fall\". Mr. Antolini advises him to begin applying himself and provides him with a place to sleep. Holden awakens to find Mr. Antolini patting his head, which he interprets as a sexual advance. He leaves and spends the rest of the night in a train-waiting room at Grand Central Terminal, sinking deeper into despair.In the morning, having lost hope of ever finding meaningful connection in the city, he decides to head out West to live as a deaf-mute gas station attendant in a log cabin. He arranges to see Phoebe at lunchtime to explain his plan and say goodbye. When they meet up at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, she arrives with a suitcase and asks to go with him. Holden refuses, which upsets Phoebe. He tries to cheer her by allowing her to skip school at the Central Park Zoo, but she remains angry. They eventually reach the carousel, where they reconcile after he buys her a ticket. The sight of her riding the carousel fills him with happiness.He alludes to encountering his parents that night, \"getting sick,\" and being sent to a sanatorium in California near his older brother, D. B. He also mentions that he will be attending another academy in September. The novel ends with Holden stating that he is reluctant to say more because talk of school has made him miss his former classmates.Various older stories by Salinger contain characters similar to those in The Catcher in the Rye. While at Columbia University, Salinger wrote a short story called \"The Young Folks\" in Whit Burnett's class; one character from this story has been described as a \"thinly penciled prototype of Sally Hayes\". In November 1941 he sold the story \"Slight Rebellion off Madison\", which featured Holden Caulfield, to The New Yorker, but it was not published until December 21, 1946, due to World War II. The story \"I'm Crazy\", which was published in the December 22, 1945 issue of Collier's, contained material that was later used in The Catcher in the Rye. In 1946, The New Yorker accepted a 90-page manuscript about Holden Caulfield for publication, but Salinger later withdrew it.[13] The school Holden attends is Pencey Preparatory Academy, a boarding school in Pennsylvania that Salinger may have based on the Valley Forge Military Academy and College.[14]The Catcher in the Rye is narrated in a subjective style from the point of view of Holden Caulfield, following his exact thought processes. There is flow in the seemingly disjointed ideas and episodes; for example, as Holden sits in a chair in his dorm, minor events, such as picking up a book or looking at a table, unfold into discussions about experiences.Critical reviews affirm that the novel accurately reflected the teenage colloquial speech of the time.[15] Words and phrases that appear frequently include:[16]Bruce Brooks held that Holden's attitude remains unchanged at story's end, implying no maturation, thus differentiating the novel from young adult fiction.[18] In contrast, Louis Menand thought that teachers assign the novel because of the optimistic ending, to teach adolescent readers that \"alienation is just a phase.\"[19] While Brooks maintained that Holden acts his age, Menand claimed that Holden thinks as an adult, given his ability to accurately perceive people and their motives. Others highlight the dilemma of Holden's state, in between adolescence and adulthood.[20][21] Holden is quick to become emotional. \"I felt sorry as hell for...\" is a phrase he often uses. It is often said that Holden changes at the end, when he watches Phoebe on the carousel, and he talks about the golden ring and how it's good for kids to try to grab it.[20]Peter Beidler in his A Reader's Companion to J. D. Salinger's \"The Catcher in the Rye\" identified the movie that the prostitute \"Sunny\" refers to. In chapter 13 she says that in the movie a boy who looked like Holden fell off a boat, and from this detail, Beidler deduced that the movie was Captains Courageous (1937), with the boy played by child-actor Freddie Bartholomew.[22]Each Caulfield child has literary talent. D. B. writes screenplays in Hollywood;[23] Holden also reveres D. B. for his writing skill (Holden's own best subject), but he also despises Hollywood industry-based movies, considering them the ultimate in \"phony\" as the writer has no space for his own imagination and describes D. B.'s move to Hollywood to write for films as \"prostituting himself\"; Allie wrote poetry on his baseball glove;[24] and Phoebe is a diarist.[25] This \"catcher in the rye\" is an analogy for Holden, who admires in children attributes that he often struggles to find in adults, like innocence, kindness, spontaneity, and generosity. Falling off the cliff could be a progression into the adult world that surrounds him and that he strongly criticizes. Later, Phoebe and Holden exchange roles as the \"catcher\" and the \"fallen\"; he gives her his hunting hat, the catcher's symbol, and becomes the fallen as Phoebe becomes the catcher.[26]In their biography of Salinger, David Shields and Shane Salerno argue that: \"The Catcher in the Rye can best be understood as a disguised war novel.\" Salinger witnessed the horrors of World War II, but rather than writing a combat novel, Salinger, according to Shields and Salerno, \"took the trauma of war and embedded it within what looked to the naked eye like a coming-of-age novel.\"[27]In his book Rebels: Youth and the Cold War Origins of Identity,[28] Professor Leerom Medovoi posits that The Catcher in the Rye is \"centered on identity\", and that Holden Caulfield \"epitomizes the triumph of the young rebel as a requisite figure for representing the national identity of America\".[28] Medovoi says that in contrast to the oppressive governance of the 1950s Soviet Union, America thought itself a plucky and rebellious player on the world stage, similar to how Holden felt in contrast with the phony adult world.The Catcher in the Rye has been consistently listed as one of the best novels of the twentieth century. Shortly after its publication, in an article for The New York Times, Nash K. Burger called it \"an unusually brilliant novel,\"[3] while James Stern wrote an admiring review of the book in a voice imitating Holden's.[29]George H. W. Bush called it a \"marvelous book,\" listing it among the books that inspired him.[30] In June 2009, the BBC's Finlo Rohrer wrote that, 58 years since publication, the book is still regarded \"as the defining work on what it is like to be a teenager.\"[31] Out of all teen demographics over the years, troubled and depressed teens seem to have a greater tendency to relate with Holden. In a 1975 interview with Robert Coles, [32]renowned child psychoanalyst Anne Freud shares her experience treating teens who read The Catcher in the Rye for school. “I got to know this Holden Caulfield by hearsay before I met him as a reader. My analytic patients spoke of him sometimes as if they’d actually met him; they used his words, his way of speaking. ... I began to realize that they had taken him into their minds, and hugged him – they spoke, now, not only his words in the book (quotations from it) but his words become their own words.\"[32]Adam Gopnik considers it one of the \"three perfect books\" in American literature, along with Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Great Gatsby, and believes that \"no book has ever captured a city better than Catcher in the Rye captured New York in the fifties.\"[33] In an appraisal of The Catcher in the Rye written after the death of J. D. Salinger, Jeff Pruchnic says the novel has retained its appeal for many generations. Pruchnic describes Holden as a \"teenage protagonist frozen midcentury but destined to be discovered by those of a similar age in every generation to come.\"[34]Not all reception has been positive. The book has had its share of naysayers, including the longtime Washington Post book critic Jonathan Yardley, who, in 2004, wrote that the experience of rereading the novel after several decades proved to be \"a painful experience: The combination of Salinger's execrable prose and Caulfield's jejune narcissism produced effects comparable to mainlining castor oil.\" Yardley described the novel as among the worst popular books in the annals of American literature. \"Why,\" Yardley asked, \"do English teachers, whose responsibility is to teach good writing, repeatedly and reflexively require students to read a book as badly written as this one?\"[35] According to Rohrer, many contemporary readers, as Yardley found, \"just cannot understand what the fuss is about.... many of these readers are disappointed that the novel fails to meet the expectations generated by the mystique it is shrouded in. J. D. Salinger has done his part to enhance this mystique. That is to say, he has done nothing.\"[31] Rohrer assessed the reasons behind both the popularity and criticism of the book, saying that it \"captures existential teenage angst\" and has a \"complex central character\" and \"accessible conversational style\"; while at the same time some readers may dislike the \"use of 1940s New York vernacular\" and the excessive \"whining\" of the \"self-obsessed character\".In 1960, a teacher in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was fired for assigning the novel in class. She was later reinstated.[36] Between 1961 and 1982, The Catcher in the Rye was the most censored book in high schools and libraries in the United States.[37] The book was briefly banned in the Issaquah, Washington, high schools in 1978 when three members of the School Board alleged the book was part of an \"overall communist plot\".[38] This ban did not last long, and the offending board members were immediately recalled and removed in a special election.[39] In 1981, it was both the most censored book and the second most taught book in public schools in the United States.[40] According to the American Library Association, The Catcher in the Rye was the 10th most frequently challenged book from 1990 to 1999.[10] It was one of the ten most challenged books of 2005,[41] and although it had been off the list for three years, it reappeared in the list of most challenged books of 2009.[42]The challenges generally begin with Holden's frequent use of vulgar language;[43][44] other reasons include sexual references,[45]blasphemy, undermining of family values[44] and moral codes,[46] encouragement of rebellion,[47] and promotion of drinking, smoking, lying, promiscuity, and sexual abuse.[46] The book was written for an adult audience, which often forms the foundation of many challengers' arguments against it.[48] Often the challengers have been unfamiliar with the plot itself.[37] Shelley Keller-Gage, a high school teacher who faced objections after assigning the novel in her class, noted that \"the challengers are being just like Holden. ... They are trying to be catchers in the rye.\"[44] Censorship of the book often causes a Streisand effect, as such incidents cause many to put themselves on the waiting list to borrow the novel, where there was no waiting list before.[49][50]Further information: The Catcher in the Rye in popular culture § ShootingsSeveral shootings have been associated with Salinger's novel, including Robert John Bardo's murder of Rebecca Schaeffer and John Hinckley Jr.'s assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan. Additionally, after fatally shooting John Lennon, Mark David Chapman was arrested with a copy of the book that he had purchased that same day, inside of which he had written: \"To Holden Caulfield, From Holden Caulfield, This is my statement\".[51][52]Commenting on the fascination of Hinckley and Chapman, Harvey Solomon-Brady wrote:In film\n[edit]Early in his career, Salinger expressed a willingness to have his work adapted for the screen.[54] In 1949, a critically panned film version of his short story \"Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut\" was released; renamed My Foolish Heart, the film took great liberties with Salinger's plot and is widely considered to be among the reasons that Salinger refused to allow any subsequent film adaptations of his work.[20][55] The enduring success of The Catcher in the Rye, however, has resulted in repeated attempts to secure the novel's screen rights.[56]When The Catcher in the Rye was first released, many offers were made to adapt it for the screen, including one from Samuel Goldwyn, producer of My Foolish Heart.[55] In a letter written in the early 1950s, Salinger spoke of mounting a play in which he would play the role of Holden Caulfield opposite Margaret O'Brien, and, if he couldn't play the part himself, to \"forget about it.\" Almost 50 years later, the writer Joyce Maynard definitively concluded, \"The only person who might ever have played Holden Caulfield would have been J. D. Salinger.\"[57]Salinger told Maynard in the 1970s that Jerry Lewis \"tried for years to get his hands on the part of Holden,\"[57] the protagonist in the novel which Lewis had not read until he was in his thirties.[49] Film industry figures including Marlon Brando, Jack Nicholson, Ralph Bakshi, Tobey Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio have tried to make a film adaptation.[58] In an interview with Premiere, John Cusack commented that his one regret about turning 21 was that he had become too old to play Holden Caulfield. Writer-director Billy Wilder recounted his abortive attempts to snare the novel's rights:In 1961, Salinger denied Elia Kazan permission to direct a stage adaptation of Catcher for Broadway.[60] Later, Salinger's agents received bids for the Catcher film rights from Harvey Weinstein and Steven Spielberg, neither of which was even passed on to Salinger for consideration.[61]In 2003, the BBC television program The Big Read featured The Catcher in the Rye, interspersing discussions of the novel with \"a series of short films that featured an actor playing J. D. Salinger's adolescent antihero, Holden Caulfield.\"[60] The show defended its unlicensed adaptation of the novel by claiming to be a \"literary review\", and no major charges were filed.In 2008, the rights of Salinger's works were placed in the JD Salinger Literary Trust where Salinger was the sole trustee. Phyllis Westberg, who was Salinger's agent at Harold Ober Associates in New York, declined to say who the trustees are now that the author is dead. After Salinger died in 2010, Westberg stated that nothing had changed in terms of licensing film, television, or stage rights of his works.[62] A letter written by Salinger in 1957 revealed that he was open to an adaptation of The Catcher in the Rye released after his death. He wrote: \"Firstly, it is possible that one day the rights will be sold. Since there's an ever-looming possibility that I won't die rich, I toy very seriously with the idea of leaving the unsold rights to my wife and daughter as a kind of insurance policy. It pleasures me no end, though, I might quickly add, to know that I won't have to see the results of the transaction.\" Salinger also wrote that he believed his novel was not suitable for film treatment, and that translating Holden Caulfield's first-person narrative into voice-over and dialogue would be contrived.[63]In 2020, Don Hahn revealed that The Walt Disney Company had almost made an animated film titled Dufus which would have been an adaptation of The Catcher in the Rye \"with German shepherds\", most likely akin to Oliver & Company. The idea came from then CEO Michael Eisner who loved the book and wanted to do an adaptation. After being told that J. D. Salinger would not agree to sell the film rights, Eisner stated, \"Well, let's just do that kind of story, that kind of growing up, coming of age story.\"[64]Banned fan sequel\n[edit]In 2009, the year before he died, Salinger successfully sued to stop the U.S. publication of a novel that presents Holden Caulfield as an old man.[31][65] The novel's author, Fredrik Colting, commented: \"call me an ignorant Swede, but the last thing I thought possible in the U.S. was that you banned books\".[66] The issue is complicated by the nature of Colting's book, 60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye, which has been compared to fan fiction.[67] Although commonly not authorized by writers, no legal action is usually taken against fan fiction, since it is rarely published commercially and thus involves no profit.[68]Main article: The Catcher in the Rye in popular cultureNotes\n[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}\"CalArts Remembers Beloved Animation Instructor E.

The Catcher in the Rye can best be understood as a disguised war novel. Salinger emerged from the war incapable of believing in the heroic, noble ideals we like to think our cultural institutions uphold. Instead of producing a combat novel, like Norman Mailer, James Jones, and Joseph Heller did, Salinger took the trauma of war and embedded it within what looked to the naked eye like a coming-of-age novel.\n^ a b Medovoi, Leerom (December 1, 2005). \"Rebels: Youth and the Cold War Origins of Identity\".

{"title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","author":"Gabriel García Márquez","published":1967,"fiction":true,"plot":"The book tells the story of seven generations of the Buendía family in the town of Macondo. The founders of Macondo, José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula Iguarán, leave their hometown after José Arcadio kills Prudencio Aguilar after a cockfight for suggesting José Arcadio was impotent.[15] One night of their emigration journey, while camping on a riverbank, José Arcadio dreams of \"Macondo\", a city of mirrors that reflected the world in and about it. Upon awakening, he decides to establish Macondo at the riverside; after days of wandering the jungle, his founding of Macondo is utopic.[10]José Arcadio Buendía believes Macondo to be surrounded by water, and from that island, he invents the world according to his perceptions.[10] Soon after its founding, Macondo became a town frequented by unusual and extraordinary events that involve the generations of the Buendía family, who are unable or unwilling to escape their periodic (mostly self-inflicted) misfortunes. For years the town has been solitary and unconnected to the outside world, with the exception of the annual visit of a band of Gypsies, who show the townspeople scientific discoveries such as magnets, telescopes, and ice. The leader of the Gypsies, a man named Melquíades, maintains a close friendship with José Arcadio, who becomes increasingly withdrawn, obsessed with investigating the mysteries of the universe presented to him by the Gypsies. Ultimately, José Arcadio is driven insane, speaking only in Latin, and is tied to a chestnut tree by his family for many years until his death.Eventually Macondo becomes exposed to the outside world and the government of newly independent Colombia. A rigged election between the Conservative and Liberal parties is held in town, inspiring Aureliano Buendía (José Arcadio’s son) to join a civil war against the Conservative government. He becomes an iconic revolutionary leader, fighting for many years and surviving multiple attempts on his life, but ultimately tires of war and signs a peace treaty with the Conservatives. Disillusioned, he returns to Macondo and spends the rest of his life making tiny gold fish in his workshop.The railroad comes to Macondo, bringing in new technology and many foreign settlers. An American fruit company establishes a banana plantation outside the town, and builds its own segregated village across the river. This ushers in a period of prosperity that ends in tragedy as the Colombian army massacres thousands of striking plantation workers, an incident based on the Banana Massacre of 1928. José Arcadio Segundo, the only survivor of the massacre, finds no evidence of the massacre, and the surviving townspeople deny or refuse to believe it happened.By the novel's end, Macondo has fallen into a decrepit and near-abandoned state, with the only remaining Buendías being Amaranta Úrsula and her nephew Aureliano, whose parentage is hidden by his grandmother Fernanda; he and Amaranta Úrsula unknowingly begin an incestuous relationship. They have a child who bears the tail of a pig, fulfilling the lifelong fear of the long-dead matriarch Úrsula. Amaranta Úrsula dies in childbirth and the child is devoured by ants, leaving Aureliano as the last member of the family. He decodes an encryption Melquíades had left behind in a manuscript generations ago. The manuscript reveals every fortune and misfortune that the Buendía family's generations lived through. As Aureliano reads the manuscript, he feels a windstorm starting around him, and he reads in the document that the Buendía family is doomed to be wiped from the face of the Earth because of it. In the last sentence of the book, the narrator describes Aureliano reading this last line just as the entire town of Macondo is scoured from existence.[16]A dominant theme in the book is the inevitable and inescapable repetition of history in Macondo. The protagonists are controlled by their pasts and the complexity of time. Throughout the novel the characters are visited by ghosts. \"The ghosts are symbols of the past and the haunting nature it has over Macondo. The ghosts and the displaced repetition that they evoke are, in fact, firmly grounded in the particular development of Latin American history\", writes Daniel Erickson. \"Ideological transfiguration ensured that Macondo and the Buendías always were ghosts to some extent, alienated and estranged from their own history, not only victims of the harsh reality of dependence and underdevelopment but also of the ideological illusions that haunt and reinforce such social conditions.\"[17]The fate of Macondo is both doomed and predetermined from its very existence. \"Fatalism is a metaphor for the particular part that ideology has played in maintaining historical dependence, by locking the interpretation of Latin American history into certain patterns that deny alternative possibilities. The narrative seemingly confirms fatalism in order to illustrate the feeling of entrapment that ideology can performatively create.\"[17]García Márquez uses colours as symbols. Yellow and gold are the most frequently used and symbolize imperialism and the Spanish Siglo de Oro. Gold signifies a search for economic wealth, whereas yellow represents death, change, and destruction.[18]The glass city is an image that comes to José Arcadio Buendía in a dream. It is the reason for Macondo's location, but also a symbol of its fate. Higgins writes, \"By the final page, however, the city of mirrors has become a city of mirages. Macondo thus represents the dream of a brave new world that America seemed to promise and that was cruelly proved illusory by the subsequent course of history.\"[10] Images such as the glass city and the ice factory represent how Latin America already has its history outlined and is therefore fated for destruction.[17]There is an underlying pattern of Latin American history in the book. It has been said that the novel is one of a number of texts that \"Latin American culture has created to understand itself.\"[19] In this sense, the novel can be conceived as a linear archive that narrates the story of a Latin America discovered by European explorers, which had its historical entity developed by the printing press. The Archive is a symbol of the literature that is the foundation of Latin American history and also a decoding instrument. Melquíades, the keeper of the archive, represents both the whimsical and the literary.[19] Finally, \"the world of One Hundred Years of Solitude is a place where beliefs and metaphors become forms of fact, and where more ordinary facts become uncertain.\"[16]The use of particular historic events and characters renders the book an exemplary work of magical realism, wherein the novel compresses decades of cause and effect whilst telling an interesting story.[20]First generation\n[edit]José Arcadio Buendía is the patriarch of the Buendía family and the founder of Macondo.[21] Buendía leaves his hometown in Riohacha Municipality, Colombia, along with his wife Úrsula Iguarán, after being haunted by the corpse of Prudencio Aguilar (a man Buendía killed in a duel), who constantly bleeds from his wound and tries to wash it.[21] One night while camping at the side of a river, Buendía dreams of a city of mirrors named Macondo and decides to establish the town in this location. José Arcadio Buendía is an introspective and inquisitive man of massive strength and energy who spends more time on his scientific pursuits than with his family. He flirts with alchemy and astronomy and becomes increasingly withdrawn from his family and community. He eventually goes insane and is tied to a chestnut tree until his death.Úrsula Iguarán is the matriarch of the Buendía family and is wife and cousin to José Arcadio Buendía.[21] She lives to be well over 100 years old and she oversees the Buendía household through six of the seven generations documented in the novel. She has a business of making candy animals and pastries which she continues until the arrival of Fernanda. She exhibits a very strong character and often succeeds where the men of her family fail, for example finding a route to the outside world from Macondo. She deeply fears her family resuming their incestuous practices as her inbred relatives tended to have animalistic features. From a strong and active matriarch, Úrsula is reduced to a plaything for Amaranta Úrsula and Aureliano in her last years and shrinks to the size of a newborn baby when she finally dies.Second generation\n[edit]José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula's firstborn child, José Arcadio seems to have inherited his father's headstrong, impulsive mannerisms.[21] He eventually leaves the family after being molested by Pilar Ternera to chase a Gypsy girl and unexpectedly returns many years later as an enormous man covered in tattoos, claiming that he has sailed the seas of the world. He marries his adopted sister Rebeca, causing his banishment from the mansion, and he dies from a mysterious gunshot wound, days after saving his brother from execution.José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula's second child and the first person to be born in Macondo.[21] He was thought to have premonitions because everything he said came true.[21] He represents not only a warrior figure but also an artist due to his ability to write poetry and create finely crafted golden fish. During the wars he fathered 17 sons by unknown women,[21] all named Aureliano. Four of them later begin to live in Macondo, and in the span of several weeks all of them but one (including those who chose not to remain in Macondo) are murdered by unknown assassins, before any of them had reached thirty-five years of age.José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula's third child, Amaranta grows up as a companion of her adopted sister Rebeca.[21] However, her feelings toward Rebeca turn sour over Pietro Crespi, whom both sisters intensely desired in their teenage years. Amaranta does everything she can to prevent Rebeca and Pietro marrying, even attempting to murder Rebeca. Amaranta dies a lonely and virginal spinster, but comfortable in her existence after having finally accepted what she had become.[21]In her later years, she becomes a caring figure within the Buendía household, particularly showing affection for her nephew, Aureliano José.[22]Remedios was the youngest daughter of the town's Conservative administrator, Don Apolinar Moscote.[21] Her most striking physical features are her beautiful skin and her emerald-green eyes. The future Colonel Aureliano falls in love with her, despite her extreme youth. She dies shortly after the marriage from a blood poisoning illness during her pregnancy. Until soon before the Colonel's death, her dolls are displayed in his bedroom.Rebeca is the second cousin of Úrsula Iguarán and the orphaned child of Nicanor Ulloa and Rebeca Montiel.[21] At first, she is extremely timid, refuses to speak, and has the habits of eating earth and whitewash from the walls of the house, a condition known as pica. She arrives carrying a canvas bag containing her parents' bones and seems not to understand or speak Spanish. However, she responds to questions asked by Visitación and Cataure in the Guajiro or Wayuu language. She falls in love with and marries her adoptive brother José Arcadio after his return from traveling the world. After his mysterious and untimely death, she lives in seclusion for the rest of her life.Pilar is a local woman who moved to Macondo to escape the man who raped her as a teenager. She sleeps with the brothers Aureliano and José Arcadio.[21] She becomes the mother of their sons, Aureliano José and Arcadio respectively.[21] Pilar reads the future with cards, and every so often makes an accurate, though vague, prediction.[21] She has close ties with the Buendías throughout the whole novel, helping them with her card predictions. She dies some time after she turns 145 years old (she had eventually stopped counting),[21] surviving until the last days of Macondo.She plays an integral part in the plot as she is the link between the second and the third generations of the Buendía family. The author highlights her importance by following her death with a declaratory \"it was the end.\"[21]Third generation\n[edit]Arcadio is José Arcadio's illegitimate son with Pilar Ternera, although he never learns about his origins.[21] He is a schoolteacher who assumes leadership of Macondo after Colonel Aureliano Buendía leaves.[21] He becomes a tyrannical dictator and uses his schoolchildren as his personal army and Macondo soon becomes subject to his whims. When the Liberal forces in Macondo fall, Arcadio is shot by a Conservative firing squad.[21]Aureliano José is Colonel Aureliano Buendía's illegitimate son with Pilar Ternera.[21] He joins his father in several wars before deserting to return to Macondo upon hearing that it is possible to marry one's aunt. Aureliano José is obsessed with his aunt, Amaranta, who raised him since birth and molested him as a child, and who rejects the marriage proposal he makes as an adult. He is eventually shot to death by a Conservative captain midway through the wars.[21]Santa Sofía is a beautiful virgin girl and the daughter of a shopkeeper.[21] She is hired by Pilar Ternera to have sex with her son Arcadio, her eventual husband.[21] She is taken in along with her children by the Buendías after Arcadio's execution. After Úrsula's death she leaves unexpectedly, not knowing her destination.During his 32 civil war campaigns, Colonel Aureliano Buendía has 17 sons by 17 different women, each named after their father.[21] Four of these Aurelianos (A. Triste, A. Serrador, A. Arcaya and A. Centeno) stay in Macondo and become a permanent part of the family. Eventually, as revenge against the Colonel, all are assassinated by unknown assailants, who identified them by the mysteriously permanent Ash Wednesday cross on their foreheads. The only survivor of the massacre is A. Amador, who escapes into the jungle only to be assassinated at the doorstep of his father's house many years later.Fourth generation\n[edit]Remedios the Beauty\nRemedios the Beauty is Arcadio and Santa Sofía's first child.[21] It is said she is the most beautiful woman ever seen in Macondo, and unintentionally causes the deaths of several men who love or lust over her.[21] She appears to most of the town as naively innocent, and some come to think that she is mentally delayed. However, Colonel Aureliano Buendía believes she has inherited great lucidity: \"It is as if she's come back from twenty years of war,\" he said. She rejects clothing and beauty which has the opposite effect and makes her more beautiful. Too beautiful and, arguably, too wise for the world, Remedios ascends to heaven one afternoon, while folding Fernanda's white sheet.José Arcadio Segundo is Aureliano Segundo's twin brother, and one of Arcadio and Santa Sofía's three children.[21] Úrsula believes that the two were switched in their childhood, as José Arcadio begins to show the characteristics of the family's Aurelianos, growing up to be pensive and quiet. He plays a major role in the banana worker strike, and is the only survivor when the company massacres the striking workers.[21] Afterward, he spends the rest of his days studying the parchments of Melquíades, and tutoring the young Aureliano. He dies at the exact instant that his twin does.[21]Aureliano Segundo is José Arcadio Segundo's twin brother, and one of Arcadio and Santa Sofía's three children. Of the two brothers, Aureliano Segundo is the more boisterous and impulsive, much like the José Arcadios of the family.[21] He takes his first girlfriend Petra Cotes as his mistress during his marriage to the beautiful and bitter Fernanda del Carpio.[21] When living with Petra, his livestock propagate wildly, and he indulges in unrestrained revelry. After the long rains, his fortune dries up, and the Buendías are left almost penniless. He turns to a search for a buried treasure, which nearly drives him to insanity. He dies of an unknown throat illness at the same moment as his twin. During the confusion at the funeral, the bodies are switched, and each is buried in the other's grave (highlighting Úrsula's earlier comment that they had been switched at birth).Fernanda del Carpio\nFernanda comes from a ruined, aristocratic family that kept her isolated from the world.[21] She was chosen as the most beautiful of 5,000 girls. She is brought to Macondo to compete with Remedios the Beauty for the title of Queen of the local carnival; however, her appearance turns the carnival into a bloody confrontation. After the fiasco, she marries Aureliano Segundo, who despite this maintains a domestic relation with his concubine, Petra Cotes. Nevertheless, she soon takes the leadership of the family away from the now frail Úrsula. She manages the Buendía affairs with an iron fist. She has three children by Aureliano Segundo: José Arcadio; Renata Remedios, a.k.a. Meme; and Amaranta Úrsula. She remains in the house after her husband dies, taking care of the household until her death.Fernanda is never accepted by anyone in the Buendía household for they regard her as an outsider, although none of the Buendías rebel against her inflexible conservatism. Her mental and emotional instability is revealed through her paranoia, her correspondence with the \"invisible doctors\", and her irrational behavior towards Meme's son Aureliano, whom she tries to isolate from the world.Petra is a dark-skinned mulatto woman with gold-brown eyes similar to those of a panther. She is Aureliano Segundo's mistress and the love of his life. She arrives in Macondo as a teenager with her first husband. After her husband dies, she begins a relationship with José Arcadio Segundo. When she meets Aureliano Segundo, she begins a relationship with him as well, not knowing they are two different men. After José Arcadio decides to leave her, Aureliano Segundo gets her forgiveness and remains by her side. He continues to see her, even after his marriage. He eventually lives with her, which greatly embitters his wife, Fernanda del Carpio. When Aureliano and Petra make love, their animals reproduce at an amazing rate, but their livestock is wiped out during the four years of rain. Petra makes money by keeping the lottery alive and provides food baskets for Fernanda and her family after the death of Aureliano Segundo.Fifth generation\n[edit]José Arcadio, named after his ancestors in the Buendía tradition, is Aureliano Segundo and Fernanda's oldest child and follows the trend of previous Arcadios.[21] He is raised by Úrsula, who intends for him to become Pope. After Fernanda's death, he returns from Rome without having become a priest. He spends his days pining for Amaranta, the object of his obsession. Eventually, he discovers the treasure Úrsula had buried under her bed, which he wastes on lavish parties and escapades with adolescent boys. Later, he begins a tentative friendship with Aureliano Babilonia, his nephew. José Arcadio plans to set Aureliano up in a business and return to Rome, but is murdered in his bath by four of the adolescent boys who ransack his house and steal his gold.Renata Remedios, or Meme, is Aureliano Segundo and Fernanda's second child and first daughter.[21] While she doesn't inherit Fernanda's beauty, she does have Aureliano Segundo's love of life and natural charisma. After her mother declares that she is to do nothing but play the clavichord, she is sent to school where she receives her performance degree as well as academic recognition. While she pursues the clavichord with \"an inflexible discipline\" to placate Fernanda, she also enjoys partying and exhibits the same tendency towards excess as her father.Meme meets and falls in love with Mauricio Babilonia, but when Fernanda discovers their affair, she arranges for Mauricio to be shot, claiming that he was a chicken thief. She then takes Meme to a convent. Meme remains mute for the rest of her life, partially because of the trauma, but also as a sign of rebellion. Several months after arriving at the convent, she gives birth to a son, Aureliano. He is sent to live with the Buendías. Aureliano arrives in a basket and Fernanda is tempted to kill the child in order to avoid shame, but instead claims he is an orphan in order to cover up her daughter's promiscuity and is forced to \"tolerate him against her will for the rest of her life because at the moment of truth she lacked the courage to go through with her inner determination to drown him\".Amaranta Úrsula is Aureliano Segundo and Fernanda's third child.[21] She displays the same characteristics as her namesake who dies when she is only a child.[21] She never knows that the child sent to the Buendía home is her nephew, the illegitimate son of Meme. He becomes her best friend in childhood. She returns home from Europe with an older husband, Gastón, who leaves her when she informs him of her passionate affair with Aureliano. She dies of a hemorrhage after she has given birth to the last of the Buendía line.[21]Mauricio is a brutally honest, generous and handsome mechanic for the banana company.[21] He is said to be a descendant of the Gypsies who visit Macondo in the early days. He has the unusual characteristic of being constantly swarmed by yellow butterflies, which follow even his lover for a time. Mauricio begins a romantic affair with Meme until Fernanda discovers them and tries to end it. When Mauricio continues to sneak into the house to see her, Fernanda has him shot, claiming he is a chicken thief. Paralyzed and bedridden, he spends the rest of his long life in solitude.Gastón is Amaranta Úrsula's wealthy, Belgian husband. She marries him in Europe and returns to Macondo leading him on a silk leash. Gastón is about fifteen years older than his wife. He is an aviator and an adventurer. When he moves with Amaranta Ursula to Macondo he thinks it is only a matter of time before she realizes that her European ways are out of place, causing her to want to move back to Europe. However, when he realizes his wife intends to stay in Macondo, he arranges for his airplane to be shipped over so he can start an airmail service. The plane is shipped to Africa by mistake. When he travels there to claim it, Amaranta writes to him of her love for Aureliano Babilonia Buendía. Gastón takes the news in stride, only asking that they ship him his velocipede.Sixth generation\n[edit]Aureliano Babilonia, or Aureliano II, is Meme's illegitimate child with Mauricio Babilonia. He is hidden from everyone by his grandmother, Fernanda. He is strikingly similar to his namesake, the Colonel, and has the same character patterns as well. He is taciturn, silent, and emotionally charged. He barely knows Úrsula, who dies during his childhood. He is a friend of José Arcadio Segundo, who explains to him the true story of the banana worker massacre.While other members of the family leave and return, Aureliano stays in the Buendía home. He only ventures into the empty town after the death of Fernanda. He works to decipher the parchments of Melquíades but stops to have an affair with his childhood partner and the love of his life, Amaranta Úrsula, not knowing that she is his aunt. When both she and her child die, he is able to decipher the parchments. \"...Melquíades' final keys were revealed to him and he saw the epigraph of the parchments perfectly placed in the order of man's time and space: 'The first in line is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by ants'.\" It is assumed he dies in the great wind that destroys Macondo the moment he finishes reading Melquíades' parchments.With his death, the Buendía line ends.Seventh generation\n[edit]Aureliano is the child of Aureliano and his aunt, Amaranta Úrsula.[21] He is born with a pig's tail, as the eldest and long dead Úrsula had always feared would happen (the parents of the child had never heard of the omen).[21] His mother dies after giving birth to him, and, due to his grief-stricken father's negligence, he is devoured by ants.[21]Others\n[edit]Melquíades is one of a band of Gypsies who visit Macondo every year in March, displaying amazing items from around the world.[21] Melquíades sells José Arcadio Buendía several new inventions including a pair of magnets and an alchemist's lab. Later, the Gypsies report that Melquíades died in Singapore, but he, nonetheless, returns to live with the Buendía family,[21] stating he could not bear the solitude of death. He stays with the Buendías and begins to write the mysterious parchments, which are eventually translated by Aureliano Babilonia, and prophesy the House of Buendía's end. Melquíades dies a second time from drowning in the river near Macondo and, following a grand ceremony organized by the Buendías, is the first individual buried in Macondo. His name echoes Melchizedek in the Old Testament, whose source of authority as a high priest was mysterious.Pietro is a very handsome and polite Italian musician who runs a music school.[21] He installs the pianola in the Buendía house. He becomes engaged to Rebeca, but Amaranta, who also loves him, manages to delay the wedding for years. When José Arcadio and Rebeca agree to be married, Pietro begins to woo Amaranta, who is so embittered that she cruelly rejects him. Despondent over the loss of both sisters, he kills himself.Mr. Herbert is a gringo who shows up at the Buendía house for lunch one day. After tasting the local bananas for the first time, he arranges for a banana company to set up a plantation in Macondo. The plantation is run by the dictatorial Jack Brown. When José Arcadio Segundo helps arrange a workers' strike on the plantation, the company traps the more than three thousand strikers and machine guns them down in the town square. The banana company and the government completely cover up the event. José Arcadio is the only one who remembers the slaughter. The company arranges for the army to kill off any resistance, then leaves Macondo for good. The event is likely based on the Banana massacre that took place in Ciénaga, Magdalena in 1928.He is the friend and comrade-in-arms of Colonel Aureliano Buendía. He fruitlessly woos Amaranta.Gabriel is only a minor character in the novel but he has the distinction of bearing almost the same name as the author. He is the great-great-grandson of Colonel Gerineldo Márquez. He and Aureliano Babilonia are close friends because they know the history of the town, which no one else believes. He leaves for Paris after winning a contest and decides to stay there, selling old newspapers and empty bottles. He is one of the few who is able to leave Macondo before the town is wiped out entirely.Subjectivity of reality and magic realism\n[edit]Critics often cite certain works by García Márquez, such as A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings and One Hundred Years of Solitude, as exemplary of magic realism, a style of writing in which the supernatural is presented as mundane, and the mundane as supernatural or extraordinary. The term was coined by German art critic Franz Roh in 1925.[23]The novel presents a fictional story in a fictional setting. The extraordinary events and characters are fabricated, yet García Márquez uses his fantastic story as an expression of reality. \"In One Hundred Years of Solitude myth and history overlap. The myth acts as a vehicle to transmit history to the reader. García Márquez's novel could also be referred to as anthropology, where truth is found in language and myth. The real and the fiction are indistinguishable.There are three main mythical elements of the novel: classical stories alluding to foundations and origins, characters resembling mythical heroes, and supernatural elements.\"[19] Magic realism is achieved by the constant intertwining of the ordinary with the extraordinary. This magic realism strikes at one's traditional sense of naturalistic fiction. There is something clearly magical about the world of Macondo. It is a state of mind as much as, or more than, a geographical place. For example, one learns very little about its actual physical layout. Furthermore, once in it, the reader must be prepared to meet whatever the imagination of the author presents to them.[24]García Márquez blends the real with the magical through the use of tone and narration. By maintaining the same tone throughout the novel, García Márquez makes the extraordinary blend with the ordinary. His condensation of events and lackadaisical manner in describing them causes the extraordinary to seem less remarkable than it actually is, further blending the real with the magical.[25] Reinforcing this effect is the unastonished tone in which the book is written. This tone restricts the ability of the reader to question the events of the novel. However, it also causes the reader to call into question the limits of reality.[16] Furthermore, maintaining the same narrator throughout the novel familiarizes the reader with his voice and causes them to become accustomed to the extraordinary events in the novel.[16]Throughout the novel, García Márquez is said to have a gift for blending the everyday with the miraculous, the historical with the fabulous, and psychological realism with surreal flights of fancy. It is a revolutionary novel that provides a looking glass into the thoughts and beliefs of its author, who chose to give a literary voice to Latin America: \"A Latin America which neither wants, nor has any reason, to be a pawn without a will of its own; nor is it merely wishful thinking that its quest for independence and originality should become a Western aspiration.\"[26]Although we are faced with a very convoluted narrative, García Márquez is able to define clear themes while maintaining individual character identities, and using different narrative techniques such as third-person narrators, specific point of view narrators, and streams of consciousness. Cinematographic techniques are also employed in the novel, with the idea of the montage and the close-up, which effectively combine the comic and grotesque with the dramatic and tragic. Furthermore, political and historical realities are combined with the mythical and magical Latin American world. Lastly, through human comedy the problems of a family, a town, and a country are unveiled. This is all presented through García Márquez's unique form of narration, which causes the novel to never cease being at its most interesting point.[27]Solitude\n[edit]Perhaps the most dominant theme in the book is that of solitude. Macondo was founded in the remote jungles of the Colombian rainforest. The solitude of the town is representative of the colonial period in Latin American history, where outposts and colonies were, for all intents and purposes, not interconnected.[10] Isolated from the rest of the world, the Buendías grow to be increasingly solitary and selfish. With every member of the family living only for him or her self, the Buendías become representative of the aristocratic, land-owning elite who came to dominate Latin America in keeping with the sense of Latin American history symbolized in the novel.[10] This egocentricity is embodied, especially, in the characters of Aureliano, who lives in a private world of his own, and Remedios the Beauty, who innocently destroys the lives of four men enamored by her unbelievable beauty, because she is living in a different reality due to what some see as autism.[10] Throughout the novel it seems as if no character can find true love or escape the destructiveness of their own egocentricity.[10]The selfishness of the Buendía family is eventually broken by the once superficial Aureliano Segundo and Petra Cotes, who discover a sense of mutual solidarity and the joy of helping others in need during Macondo's economic crisis.[10] The pair even find love, and their pattern is repeated by Aureliano Babilonia and Amaranta Úrsula.[10] Eventually, Aureliano and Amaranta Úrsula have a child, and the latter is convinced that it will represent a fresh start for the once-conceited Buendía family.[10] However, the child turns out to be the perpetually feared monster with the pig's tail.Nonetheless, the appearance of love represents a shift in Macondo, albeit one that leads to its destruction. \"The emergence of love in the novel to displace the traditional egoism of the Buendías reflects the emergence of socialist values as a political force in Latin America, a force that will sweep away the Buendías and the order they represent.\"[10] The book's ending could be a wishful prediction by García Márquez, a well-known socialist, regarding the future of Latin America.[10]Fluidity of time\n[edit]The book contains several ideas concerning time. Although the story can be read as a linear progression of events, both when considering individual lives and Macondo's history, García Márquez allows room for several other interpretations of time:Incest\n[edit]A recurring theme in the book is the Buendía family's propensity towards incest. The patriarch of the family, Jose Arcadio Buendía, is the first of numerous Buendías to intermarry when he marries his first cousin, Úrsula. Furthermore, the fact that \"throughout the novel the family is haunted by the fear of punishment in the form of the birth of a monstrous child with a pig's tail\"[10] can be attributed to this initial act and the recurring acts of incest among the Buendías.[10]Elitism\n[edit]A theme throughout the book is the elitism of the Buendía family. Gabriel García Márquez shows his criticism of the Latin American elite through the stories of the members of a high-status family who are essentially in love with themselves, to the point of being unable to understand the mistakes of their past and learn from them.[31] The Buendía family's literal loving of themselves through incest not only shows how elites consider themselves to be above the law, but also reveals how little they learn from their history.[31] José Arcadio Buendía and Ursula fear that since their relationship is incestuous, their child will have animalistic features;[32] even though theirs does not, the final child of the Buendía line, Aureliano of Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula, has the tail of a pig, and because they do not know their history, they do not know that this fear has materialized before, nor do they know that, had the child lived, removing the tail would have resulted in his death.[32] This speaks to how elites in Latin America do not pass down history that remembers them in a negative manner. The Buendía family further cannot move beyond giving tribute to themselves in the form of naming their children the same names over and over again. \"José Arcadio\" appears four times in the family tree, \"Aureliano\" appears 22 times, \"Remedios\" appears three times and \"Amaranta\" and \"Ursula\" appear twice.[32] The continual references to the sprawling Buendía house call to mind the idea of a Big House, or hacienda, a large land holding in which elite families lived and managed their lands and laborers.[33] In Colombia, where the novel takes place, a Big House was known for being a grand one-story dwelling with many bedrooms, parlors, a kitchen, a pantry and a veranda, all areas of the Buendía household mentioned throughout the book.[33] The book focuses squarely on one family in the midst of the many residents of Macondo as a representation of how the poorest of Latin American villages have been subjugated and forgotten throughout the course of Latin American history.[31]Literary significance and acclaim\n[edit]The book has received universal recognition. The novel has been awarded Italy's Chianciano Award, France's Prix de Meilleur Livre Etranger, Venezuela's Rómulo Gallegos Prize, and the United States' Books Abroad/Neustadt International Prize for Literature. García Márquez also received an honorary LL.D. from Columbia University in New York City. These awards set the stage for García Márquez's 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature. The novel topped the list of books that have most shaped world literature over the last 25 years, according to a survey of international writers commissioned by the global literary journal Wasafiri as a part of its 25th-anniversary celebration.[35]The superlatives from reviewers and readers alike display the resounding praise which the novel has received. Chilean poet and Nobel Laureate Pablo Neruda called it \"the greatest revelation in the Spanish language since Don Quixote of Cervantes\", while John Leonard in The New York Times wrote that \"with a single bound, Gabriel García Márquez leaps onto the stage with Günter Grass and Vladimir Nabokov.\"[11]According to Antonio Sacoto, professor at the City College of the City University of New York, the book is considered one of the five key novels in Hispanic American literature (together with El Señor Presidente, Pedro Páramo, La Muerte de Artemio Cruz, and La ciudad y los perros). These novels are often considered representative of the boom that allowed Hispanic American literature to reach the quality of North American and European literature in terms of technical quality, rich themes, and linguistic innovations, among other attributes.[27]In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, García Márquez addressed the significance of his writing and proposed its role to be more than just literary expression:Harold Bloom remarked, \"My primary impression, in the act of rereading One Hundred Years of Solitude, is a kind of aesthetic battle fatigue, since every page is rammed full of life beyond the capacity of any single reader to absorb... There are no wasted sentences, no mere transitions, in this novel, and you must notice everything at the moment you read it.\"[37]David Haberly has argued that García Márquez may have borrowed themes from several works, such as William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, Virginia Woolf's Orlando: A Biography, Defoe's A Journal of the Plague Year, and Chateaubriand's Atala, in an example of intertextuality.[38]In 2017, Chilean artist Luisa Rivera illustrated a fiftieth anniversary special edition of the book published by Penguin Random House Group Editorial, Spain.[39]Relation to Colombian history\n[edit]As a metaphoric, critical interpretation of Colombian history, from foundation to contemporary nation, the book presents different national myths through the story of the Buendía family,[20] whose spirit of adventure places them amidst the important actions of Colombian historical events. These events include the inclusion of the Roma \"Gypsies\", the Liberal political reformation of a colonial way of life, and the 19th-century arguments for and against it; the arrival of the railway to a mountainous country; the Thousand Days' War (Guerra de los Mil Días, 1899–1902); the corporate hegemony of the United Fruit Company (\"American Fruit Company\" in the story); the cinema; the automobile; and the military massacre of striking workers as government–labour relations policy.[16]Inclusion of the Roma (\"Gypsies\")\n[edit]According to Hazel Marsh, a Senior Lecturer in Latin American Studies at the University of East Anglia, it is estimated that 8,000 Roma live in Colombia today. However, \"most South American history books...exclude the presence of the Roma.\"[40]One Hundred Years of Solitude differs from this tendency by including the traveling Roma throughout the story. Led by a man named Melquíades, the Roma bring new discoveries and technology to the isolated village of Macondo, often inciting the curiosity of José Arcadio Buendía.Depiction of the Thousand Days War\n[edit]The Thousand Days' War in Colombia was fought between Liberals and Conservatives from 1899 to 1902. The Conservatives had been \"in control more or less constantly since 1867\", and the Liberals, mainly coffee plantation owners and workers who had been excluded from representation, sparked a revolution in October 1899.[41] The fighting continued for a few years, and it is estimated that over 130,000 people died.In Chapters 5 and 6, the Conservative Army has invaded the town of Macondo, leading Aureliano to eventually lead a rebellion. The rebellion is successful – the Conservative Army falls – and, afterwards, Aureliano, now \"Colonel Aureliano Buendía\", decides to continue fighting. He departs Macondo with the band of people who helped him oust the Conservative Army to go continue fighting elsewhere for the Liberal side.Because Macondo is a fictional town created by Gabriel García Márquez, the exact events of the Thousand Days' War as they occurred in the book are fictional. However, these events are widely considered to be metaphorical for the Thousand Days' War as experienced by the entire country of Colombia.Martial law\n[edit]In 1928, martial law was declared through Decree No.1, which prohibited the dissolution of any meeting of more than three individuals, allowed the military to shoot the strikers if necessary and prohibited the multitude to move after the military bugle sounds.[42] Differently, the Decree read in front of the station of Macondo is Decree No. 4.[43] However, the content of this decree corresponds to the one of Decree No.1, with regards to giving the power to the military to shoot to kill.[44] Furthermore, Decree No.1 corresponds almost exactly to the length of Decree No.4 read in Macondo, which García Márquez claims to be composed of three articles of eighty words in total. In reality, the official text of Decree No. 1 contains seventy-five words, and it is composed of three provisions in total as well. Decree No. 4 which, according to García Márquez, called the strikers, a “bunch of hoodlums”,[45] was in reality, adopted only the day after the massacre took place, i.e. on 7th December 1928.[46] This Decree was also composed by three provisions and the first article declared the strikers a “cuadrilla de malhechores”, i.e. group of criminals.[47] Additionally, it allowed the army to prosecute any person correlated to the strike and accused the strikers of setting fire to building, looting, cutting communications and attacking peaceful citizens.[48]Representation of the \"Banana Massacre\"\n[edit]The \"Banana Massacre\" occurred December 5–6, 1928, in Ciénega near Santa Marta, Colombia. Banana plantation workers had been striking against the United Fruit Company to earn better labor conditions when members of the local military fired guns into crowds.[49]This event, which occurs in Chapter 15, was depicted with relative accuracy, minus a false sense of certainty about the specific facts surrounding the events. For instance, although García Márquez writes that there must have been \"three thousand...dead\", the true number of victims is unknown. However, the number likely was not far off, because it is considered that the \"number of killings was over a thousand\", according to Dr. Jorge Enrique Elias Caro and Dr. Antonino Vidal Ortega.[49] The lack of information surrounding the \"Banana Massacre\" is thought to be largely due to the \"manipulation of the information as registered by the Colombian Government and the United Fruit Company\".[49] This uncertainty is also reflected in the novel’s portrayal of the aftermath, where official denial is emphasized through a fictional legal response where “ six lawyers argue that ‘the banana company did not have, never had had, and never would have any workers in its service,’ and the court establishes ‘in solemn decrees that the workers did not exist’”.[50] This moment illustrates how the novel mirrors the historical ambiguity and conflicting narratives that surrounded the real event.In the novel's account of the civil war and subsequent peace, there are numerous mentions of the pensions not arriving for the veterans, a reference to one of García Márquez's earlier works, El coronel no tiene quien le escriba. In the novel's final chapter, García Márquez refers to the novel Hopscotch (Spanish: Rayuela) by Julio Cortázar in the following line: \"...in the room that smelled of boiled cauliflower where Rocamadour was to die\" (p. 412). Rocamadour is a fictional character in Hopscotch who indeed dies in the room described. He also refers to two other major works by Latin American writers in the novel: The Death of Artemio Cruz (Spanish: La Muerte de Artemio Cruz) by Carlos Fuentes and Explosion in a Cathedral (Spanish: El siglo de las luces) by Alejo Carpentier.[citation needed]Shūji Terayama's play One Hundred Years of Solitude (Hyakunen no godoku 百年の孤独; originally performed by the Tenjō Sajiki theater troupe) and his film Farewell to the Ark (Saraba hakobune さらば箱舟) are loose (and unauthorized) adaptations of the novel transplanted into the realm of Japanese culture and history.Television seriesMain article: One Hundred Years of Solitude (TV series)On March 6, 2019, García Márquez's son Rodrigo García Barcha announced that Netflix was adapting the book into a TV series.[51][52][53]On October 21, 2022, Netflix commemorated the fortieth anniversary of the announcement of García Márquez's Nobel Prize in Literature with an exclusive preview of One Hundred Years of Solitude.[54]On the tenth anniversary of García Márquez's death, Netflix released the official teaser for One Hundred Years of Solitude and revealed that the series will run for sixteen episodes. The cast includes Claudio Cataño (Colonel Aureliano Buendía), Jerónimo Barón (young Aureliano Buendía), Marco González (Jose Arcadio Buendía), Leonardo Soto (José Arcadio), Susana Morales (Úrsula Iguarán), Ella Becerra (Petronila Iguarán), Carlos Suaréz (Aureliano Iguarán), Moreno Borja (Melquiades), and Santiago Vásquez (teenage Aureliano Buendía).[55][56]The book is considered by fans to be García Márquez's masterpiece yet he himself refused to sell the screening rights to his novel because he did not want it to be adapted in any language other than Spanish and felt a film adaptation would not cover the entire plot due to its length. For its TV adaptation, Netflix worked with Rodrigo and Gonzalo García who served as the show's executive producers. The episodes were all shot in the late writer's native Colombia and directed by Alex García Lopez, and all the characters' lines are spoken in Spanish. Barbara Enriquez, who had previously worked on Netflix's Roma, served as the show's production designer. The TV series is Netflix's most expensive Latin American-made project to date, with Colombian groups and indigenous communities making and providing props, and a total of four hundred fifty locals building three different versions of Macondo for the progression of the series.[57]In García Márquez's birthplace of Aracataca, the locals were disappointed that the TV series was not shot there, yet they still hope that it will draw people in.[58]The series premiered on December 11, 2024.[59]^ a b .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}\"The 50 Most Influential Books of All Time\".

{"title":"Lolita","author":"Vladimir Nabokov","published":1955,"fiction":true,"plot":"The novel is prefaced by a fictitious foreword by one John Ray Jr., an editor of psychology books. Ray states that he is presenting a memoir written by a man using the pseudonym \"Humbert Humbert\",[a] who had recently died of heart disease while in jail awaiting trial for an unspecified crime. The memoir, which addresses the audience as his jury, begins with Humbert's birth in Paris in 1910 to an English mother and Swiss father. He spends his childhood on the French Riviera, where he falls in love with his friend Annabel Leigh. This youthful and physically unfulfilled love is interrupted by Annabel's premature death from typhus, which causes Humbert to become sexually obsessed with a specific type of girl, aged 9 to 14, whom he refers to as \"nymphets\".After graduation, Humbert works as a teacher of French literature and begins editing an academic literary textbook, making passing references to repeated stays in mental institutions at this time. He is briefly married to a woman named Valeria before she leaves him for another man. Before the outbreak of World War II, Humbert emigrates to the United States. In 1947, he moves to Ramsdale, a small town in New England, where he can calmly continue working on his book. The house that he intends to live in is destroyed in a fire. In his search for a new home, he meets the widow Charlotte Haze, who is looking for a lodger. Humbert visits Charlotte's residence out of politeness and initially intends to decline her offer. However, Charlotte leads Humbert to her garden, where her 12-year-old daughter Dolores (also variably known as Dolly, Lo, and Lola) is sunbathing. Humbert sees in Dolores, whom he calls Lolita, the perfect nymphet and the embodiment of his first love Annabel, and quickly decides to move in.The impassioned Humbert constantly searches for discreet forms of fulfilling his sexual urges, usually via the smallest physical contact with Dolores. When she is sent to summer camp, Humbert receives a letter from Charlotte, who confesses her love for him and gives him an ultimatum—he is to either marry her or move out immediately. Initially terrified, Humbert then begins to see the charm in the situation of being Dolores' stepfather, and so he marries Charlotte. After the wedding, Humbert experiments with drugging Charlotte with sleeping pills with the intention of later sedating both her and Dolores so that he can sexually assault Dolores. But while Dolores is at summer camp, Charlotte discovers Humbert's diary, in which she learns of his desire for her daughter and the disgust he feels towards Charlotte. Shocked and humiliated, Charlotte announces her plan to leave, taking Dolores with her, having already written a number of letters to her friends warning them of Humbert. Disbelieving his false assurance that the diary is only a sketch for a future novel, Charlotte runs out of the house to send the letters but is hit and killed by a swerving car.Humbert destroys the letters and retrieves Dolores from camp, claiming that her mother has fallen seriously ill and has been hospitalized. He then takes her to a high-end hotel that Charlotte had earlier recommended, where he tricks her into taking a sedative by saying it is a vitamin. As he waits for the pill to take effect, he wanders through the hotel and meets a mysterious man who seems to be aware of Humbert's plan for Dolores. Humbert excuses himself from the conversation and returns to the hotel room. There, he discovers that he has been fobbed off with a milder drug, as Dolores is merely drowsy and wakes up frequently, drifting in and out of sleep. He dares not initiate sexual contact with her that night.In the morning, Dolores reveals to Humbert that she engaged in sexual activity with an older boy while at camp that summer. Humbert then advances on Dolores, raping her. After leaving the hotel, Humbert reveals to Dolores that her mother is dead. In the coming days, the two travel across the country, driving all day and staying in motels, where Dolores often cries at night. Humbert desperately tries to maintain Dolores' interest in travel and himself, increasingly bribing her in exchange for sexual favors. They finally settle in Beardsley, a small New England town. Humbert adopts the role of Dolores' father and enrolls her in a local private school for girls.Humbert jealously and strictly controls all of Dolores' social gatherings and forbids her from dating and attending parties. It is only at the instigation of the school headmaster, who regards Humbert as a strict and conservative European parent, that he agrees to Dolores' participation in the school play, the title of which is the same as the hotel in which Humbert met the mysterious man. The day before the premiere of the performance, Dolores runs out of the house following an argument with Humbert. He chases after her and finds her in a nearby drugstore drinking an ice cream soda. She then tells him she wants to leave town for another road trip. Humbert is initially delighted, but as they travel, he becomes increasingly suspicious. He feels that he is being followed by someone Dolores is familiar with.Humbert increasingly displays signs of paranoia and mania, perhaps caused by his growing certainty that he and Dolores are being trailed by someone who wants to separate them. In the Colorado mountains, Dolores falls ill. Humbert checks her into a local hospital, from where she is discharged one night by her \"uncle\". Humbert knows she has no living relatives, and he immediately embarks on a frantic search to find Dolores and her abductor but initially fails. For the next two years, Humbert barely sustains himself in a moderately functional relationship with a young alcoholic named Rita.Deeply depressed, Humbert unexpectedly receives a letter from a 17-year-old Dolores, telling him that she is married, pregnant, and in desperate need of money. Humbert, armed with a pistol, tracks down her address against her wishes. At Dolores' request, he pretends to be her estranged father and does not mention the details of their past relationship to her husband, Richard. Dolores reveals to Humbert that her abductor was the famous playwright Clare Quilty, who had crossed paths with Humbert and Dolores several times. She explains that Quilty tracked the pair with her assistance, and took her from the hospital because she was in love with him. However, he later kicked her out when she refused to star in one of his pornographic films. Humbert claims to the reader that at this moment, he realized that he was in love with Dolores all along. Humbert implores her to leave with him, but she refuses. Accepting her decision, Humbert gives her the money she is owed from her inheritance. Humbert then goes to the drug-addled Quilty's mansion and shoots him dead.Shortly afterward, Humbert is arrested, and in his closing thoughts, he reaffirms his love for Dolores and asks for his memoir to be withheld from public release until after her death. The deaths of Humbert (shortly after his imprisonment) and Dolores (in childbirth on Christmas Day 1952) have already been related in the foreword.Lolita is frequently described as an \"erotic novel\", not only by some critics but also in a standard reference work on literature, Facts on File: Companion to the American Short Story.[2] The Great Soviet Encyclopedia called Lolita \"an experiment in combining an erotic novel with an instructive novel of manners\".[3] The same description of the novel is found in Desmond Morris's reference work The Book of Ages.[4] A survey of books for women's studies courses describes it as a \"tongue-in-cheek erotic novel\".[5] Books focused on the history of erotic literature such as Michael Perkins' The Secret Record: Modern Erotic Literature also so classify Lolita.[6] More cautious classifications have included a \"novel with erotic motifs\",[7] or one of \"a number of works of classical erotic literature and art, and to novels that contain elements of eroticism, such as Ulysses and Lady Chatterley's Lover.\"[8]This classification has been disputed. Malcolm Bradbury writes that \"at first famous as an erotic novel, Lolita soon won its way as a literary one—a late modernist distillation of the whole crucial mythology.\"[9] Samuel Schuman says that Nabokov \"is a surrealist, linked to Gogol, Dostoevsky, and Kafka. Lolita is characterized by irony and sarcasm; it is not an erotic novel.\"[10]Lance Olsen writes: \"The first 13 chapters of the text, culminating with the oft-cited scene of Lo unwittingly stretching her legs across Humbert's excited lap ... are the only chapters suggestive of the erotic.\"[11] Nabokov himself observes in the novel's afterword that a few readers were \"misled [by the opening of the book] ... into assuming this was going to be a lewd book ... [expecting] the rising succession of erotic scenes; when these stopped, the readers stopped, too, and felt bored.\"[12]The novel is narrated by Humbert, who riddles the narrative with word play and his wry observations of American culture. The novel's flamboyant style is characterized by double entendres, multilingual puns, anagrams, and coinages such as nymphet, a word that has since had a life of its own and can be found in most dictionaries, and the lesser-used \"faunlet\". For Richard Rorty, in his interpretation of Lolita in Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity, Humbert is a \"monster of incuriosity\",[13]: 161  dramatizing \"the particular form of cruelty about which Nabokov worried most – incuriosity\" in that he is \"exquisitely sensitive to everything which affects or provides expression for his own obsession, and entirely incurious about anything that affects anyone else.\"[13]: 158 Nabokov, who famously decried social satire, novels with direct political messages, and those he considered \"moralists\", avoided providing any overt interpretations to his work. However, when prompted in a 1967 interview with: \"Your sense of the immorality of the relationship between Humbert Humbert and Lolita is very strong. In Hollywood and New York, however, relationships are frequent between men of forty and girls very little older than Lolita. They marry—to no particular public outrage; rather, public cooing\", he replied:Nabokov described Humbert as \"a vain and cruel wretch who manages to appear 'touching'\" later in the same interview.[14][15] When asked about coming up with Humbert's doubled name, he described it as \"... a hateful name for a hateful person. It is also a kingly name, and I did need a royal vibration for Humbert the Fierce and Humbert the Humble.\"[16]Critics have further noted that, since the novel is a first person narrative by Humbert, the novel gives very little information about what Lolita is like as a person, that in effect she has been silenced by not being the book's narrator. Nomi Tamir-Ghez writes: \"Not only is Lolita's voice silenced, her point of view, the way she sees the situation and feels about it, is rarely mentioned and can be only surmised by the reader ... since it is Humbert who tells the story ... throughout most of the novel, the reader is absorbed in Humbert's feelings.\"[17] Similarly Mica Howe and Sarah Appleton Aguiar write that the novel silences and objectifies Lolita.[18] Christine Clegg notes that this is a recurring theme in criticism of the novel in the 1990s.[19] Actor Brian Cox, who played Humbert in a 2009 one-man stage monologue based on the novel, stated that the novel is \"not about Lolita as a flesh and blood entity. It's Lolita as a memory.\" He concluded that a stage monologue would be truer to the book than any film could possibly be.[20] Elizabeth Janeway, writing in The New York Times Book Review, holds: \"Humbert is every man who is driven by desire, wanting his Lolita so badly that it never occurs to him to consider her as a human being, or as anything but a dream-figment made flesh.\"[21]Clegg sees the novel's non-disclosure of Lolita's feelings as directly linked to the fact that her real name is Dolores and only Humbert refers to her as Lolita.[22] Humbert also states he has effectively \"solipsized\" Lolita early in the novel.[23] Eric Lemay writes:In 2003, Iranian expatriate Azar Nafisi published the memoir Reading Lolita in Tehran about a covert women's reading group. In an NPR interview, Nafisi contrasts the sorrowful and seductive sides of Dolores/Lolita's character. She notes: \"Because her name is not Lolita, her real name is Dolores which, as you know, in Latin means dolour, so her real name is associated with sorrow and with anguish and with innocence, while Lolita becomes a sort of light-headed, seductive, and airy name. The Lolita of our novel is both of these at the same time and in our culture here today we only associate it with one aspect of that little girl and the crassest interpretation of her.\" Following Nafisi's comments, the NPR interviewer, Madeleine Brand, lists as embodiments of the latter side of Lolita \"the Long Island Lolita, Britney Spears, the Olsen twins, and Sue Lyon in Stanley Kubrick's Lolita.\"[25]For Nafisi, the essence of the novel is Humbert's solipsism and his erasure of Lolita's independent identity. She writes: \"Lolita was given to us as Humbert's creature ... To reinvent her, Humbert must take from Lolita her own real history and replace it with his own ... Yet she does have a past. Despite Humbert's attempts to orphan Lolita by robbing her of her history, that past is still given to us in glimpses.\"[26]One of the novel's early champions, Lionel Trilling, warned in 1958 of the moral difficulty in interpreting a book with so eloquent and so self-deceived a narrator: \"we find ourselves the more shocked when we realize that, in the course of reading the novel, we have come virtually to condone the violation it presents ... we have been seduced into conniving in the violation, because we have permitted our fantasies to accept what we know to be revolting.\"[27]In 1958, Dorothy Parker described the novel as \"the engrossing, anguished story of a man, a man of taste and culture, who can love only little girls\" and Lolita as \"a dreadful little creature, selfish, hard, vulgar, and foul-tempered\".[28] In 1959, novelist Robertson Davies wrote that the theme of Lolita is \"not the corruption of an innocent child by a cunning adult, but the exploitation of a weak adult by a corrupt child. This is no pretty theme, but it is one with which social workers, magistrates and psychiatrists are familiar.\"[29]In his essay on Stalinism Koba the Dread, Martin Amis proposes that Lolita is an elaborate metaphor for the totalitarianism that destroyed the Russia of Nabokov's childhood (though Nabokov states in his afterword that he \"[detests] symbols and allegories\"). Amis interprets it as a story of tyranny told from the point of view of the tyrant. \"Nabokov, in all his fiction, writes with incomparable penetration about delusion and coercion, about cruelty and lies,\" he says. \"Even Lolita, especially Lolita, is a study in tyranny.\"The term \"Lolita\" has been assimilated into popular culture as a description of a young girl who is \"precociously seductive ... without connotations of victimization\".[30] In Japan, the novel gave rise in the early 1980s to lolicon, a genre of fictional media in which young (or young-looking) girl characters appear in romantic or sexual contexts.Unreliable narration\n[edit]Literary critics and commentators almost universally regard Humbert as an unreliable narrator, although the nature of his unreliability is a matter of debate.[31]: 13 [32]: 55–56  The literary critic Wayne C. Booth coined the term \"unreliable narrator\" to describe a narrator whose ethical norms differ from those of the implied author.[33]: 158–159  While Booth's definition has served as the basis for most subsequent narratological analysis,[34] some commentators have disregarded his definition to classify Humbert as unreliable based on the dishonesty of his character and motives.[32]: 55–56 Booth places Humbert in a literary tradition of unreliable narrators that is \"full of traps for the unsuspecting reader, some of them not particularly harmful but some of them crippling or even fatal\".[33]: 239  Booth cites Trilling's inability to decide whether or not Humbert's final indictment of his own morality is to be taken seriously, and Trilling's conclusion that \"this ambiguity made the novel better, not worse\" in its \"ability to arouse uneasiness,\" as evidence of irony's literary triumph over \"clarity and simplicity\".[33]: 371–372  For Booth, one of Lolita's main appeals is \"watching Humbert almost make a case for himself\" as Nabokov gives him \"full and unlimited control of the rhetorical resources\". Booth trusts that \"skilful and mature\" readers will repudiate \"Humbert's blandishments\", picking up on Nabokov's ironies, clues and \"dead giveaway\" style, but many readers \"will identify Humbert with the author more than Nabokov intends\", unable to dissociate themselves \"from a vicious center of consciousness presented ... with all of the seductive self-justification of skilful rhetoric\".[33]: 390–391 Literary scholar James Phelan notes that Booth's commentary on Lolita served as a \"flashpoint\" for resistance from readers of the New Criticism school to Booth's conception of fiction as rhetorical action.[b] Booth acknowledges that Nabokov marks Humbert as unreliable while also complaining about Lolita's morality; he considers the novel \"delightful\" and \"profound\", while also condemning Humbert's actions in violating Lolita.[35]: 223  Phelan addresses this problem of the relation between technique and ethics in Lolita by attempting to account for \"two especially notable groups of readers\": \"those who are taken in by Humbert's artful narration\" and those who resist \"all of his rhetorical appeals\".[35]: 223  Phelan theorizes that accounting for these two audiences will also account for the relations between two groups often separated by rhetorical theory, the \"authorial audience\" (the hypothetical readers for whom the author writes and who ground the author's rhetorical choices) and the \"flesh and blood readers\" (the people actually reading the book).[35]: 223 Phelan distinguishes two techniques of unreliable narration – \"estranging unreliability\", which increases the distance between narrator and audience, and \"bonding unreliability\", which reduces the distance between narrator and audience[35]: 223–224  – and argues that Nabokov employs both types of unreliability, and \"a coding in which he gives the narration many marks of bonding unreliability but ultimately marks it as estranging unreliability\". In this way, Nabokov persuades the authorial audience towards Humbert before estranging them from him.[35]: 232  Phelan concludes that this process results in two misreadings of the novel: many readers will be taken in by Humbert's narration, missing the marks of estranging unreliability or detecting only some of the narrator's tricks, while other readers, in decoding the estranging unreliability, will conclude that all of Humbert's narration is unreliable.[35]: 236 William Riggan places Humbert in a tradition of unreliable narration embodied by the fool or clown, in particular the disguised insight of the wise fool and the ironies, variations and ambiguities of the sotie.[31]: 82  For Riggan, Humbert's imprisonment in art and solipsism makes his account a parodic burlesque of confessional writing that suspends the possibility of a realistic fiction in which Humbert's point of view is credible.[31]: 94–85  While superficially allied in his artistic aims with Nabokov's \"espousal of esthetic bliss as the foremost criterion in the novel,\"[31]: 92  Humbert separates himself with his contradictory depictions of himself and Lolita as literary constructs. Humbert depicts himself as \"alternately monstrous, buffoonish ... witty, brutish, tender, malevolent, and kind\".[31]: 93  He self-consciously casts himself in the buffoonish role of \"a combination of urbane satirist, brutish satyr, and sadly gleeful Harlequin\".[31]: 176  He both caricatures Lolita as commonplace and idealizes her into a solipsized vision entirely different from the real Lolita.[31]: 93  Riggan sees Humbert as personifying \"the spirit of Harlequin or a sottie clown who annihilates reality, turns life into a game and the world upside down, and ends by creating chaos\".[31]: 97 Some critics point to chronological discrepancies in Lolita as intentional and \"centrally relevant\" to Humbert's unreliable narration. Christina Tekiner views the discrepancies as evidence that the last nine chapters of the novel are a product of Humbert's imagination, and Leona Toker believes that the \"crafty handling of dates\" exposes Humbert's \"cognitive unreliability\". Other critics, such as Brian Boyd, explain the discrepancies as Nabokov's errors.[36]Nabokov finished Lolita on 6 December 1953, five years after starting it.[37] Because of its subject matter, Nabokov intended to publish it pseudonymously (although the anagrammatic character Vivian Darkbloom would tip off the alert reader).[38] The manuscript was turned down, with more or less regret, by Viking, Simon & Schuster, New Directions, Farrar, Straus, and Doubleday.[39] After these refusals and warnings, he finally resorted to publication in France. Via his translator Doussia Ergaz, it reached Maurice Girodias of Olympia Press, \"three-quarters of [whose] list was pornographic trash\".[40] Underinformed about Olympia, overlooking hints of Girodias's approval of the conduct of a protagonist Girodias presumed was based on the author, and despite warnings from Morris Bishop, his friend at Cornell, Nabokov signed a contract with Olympia Press for publication of the book, to come out under his own name.[41]Lolita was published in September 1955, as a pair of green paperbacks \"swarming with typographical errors\".[42] Although the first printing of 5,000 copies sold out, there were no substantial reviews.[43] Eventually, at the very end of 1955, Graham Greene, in the London Sunday Times, called it one of the three best books of 1955.[44] This statement provoked a response from the London Sunday Express, whose editor John Gordon called it \"the filthiest book I have ever read\" and \"sheer unrestrained pornography\".[45]British Customs officers were then instructed by the Home Office to seize all copies entering the United Kingdom.[46] In December 1956, France followed suit, and the Minister of the Interior banned Lolita;[47] the ban lasted for two years. Its eventual British publication by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in London in 1959 was controversial enough to contribute to the end of the political career of the Conservative member of parliament Nigel Nicolson, one of the company's partners.[48]The novel then appeared in Danish and Dutch translations. Two editions of a Swedish translation were withdrawn at the author's request.[49][50]Despite initial trepidation, there was no official response in the U.S., and the first American edition was issued by G. P. Putnam's Sons in August 1958. The book was into a third printing within days and became the first since Gone with the Wind to sell 100,000 copies in its first three weeks.[51]Orville Prescott, the influential book reviewer of the New York Times, greatly disliked the book, describing it as \"dull, dull, dull in a pretentious, florid and archly fatuous fashion\".[52] This review failed to influence the book's sales and it is estimated that Lolita had sold 50 million copies by 2005.[25]Lolita was later translated into Russian by Nabokov himself and published in New York City in 1967 by Phaedra Publishers.[53]Present-day views\n[edit]The novel continues to generate controversy today as modern society has become increasingly aware of the lasting damage created by child sexual abuse. In 2008, an entire book, Approaches to Teaching Nabokov's Lolita, was published on the best ways to teach the novel in a college classroom given that \"its particular mix of narrative strategies, ornate allusive prose, and troublesome subject matter complicates its presentation to students\".[54] In this book, one author urges teachers to note that Dolores' suffering is noted in the book even if the main focus is on Humbert.[citation needed]Many critics describe Humbert as a rapist, notably Azar Nafisi in her best-selling Reading Lolita in Tehran,[55] though in a survey of critics Elizabeth Patnoe notes that other interpreters of the novel have been reluctant to use that term,[56]: 133  despite Patnoe's observation that Humbert's actions \"can only be interpreted as rape\".[56]: 115  Patnoe finds that many critics \"sympathetically incorporate Humbert's language into their own\", or believe Lolita seduces Humbert while emphasizing Humbert's responsibility. Of those who claim that Humbert rapes Lolita, Patnoe finds that many \"go on to subvert the claim by confounding love and rape\".[56]: 133 Near the end of the novel, Humbert states that had he been his own sentencing judge, he \"would have given Humbert at least thirty-five years for rape\".[57] Nabokov biographer Brian Boyd denies that it was rape \"in any ordinary sense\", on the grounds that \"it is she who suggests that they try out the naughty trick\" which she has already learned at summer camp.[58] This perspective is vigorously disputed by Peter Rabinowitz in his essay \"Lolita: Solipsized or Sodomized?\".[59] Rabinowitz argues that in seeking metaphorical readings and generalized meaning,[59]: 331–332  academic readers viewing Lolita within the frame of high art[59]: 327  are \"standing back from the situation — a posture that leads, in this case, to a blame-the-victim reading by turning this victimized child into a femme fatale, a cruel mistress, a girl without emotions.\"[59]: 337 In 2015, Joanne Harris wrote for The Independent about the enduring controversy and fascination with Lolita, saying: \"This novel, so often condemned as obscene, contains not a single explicit phrase, but instead radiates colour and sensuality throughout, spinning the straw of obscenity into the gold of rapture. Perhaps this is the real reason for the outrage that greeted its publication. Paedophilia is not a subject that should be linked with poetry.\"[60]In 2020, a podcast hosted by Jamie Loftus set out to examine the cultural legacy of the novel, and argued that depictions and adaptations have \"twisted\" Nabokov's original intention of condemning Humbert in Lolita.[61][62]Links in Nabokov's work\n[edit]In 1928, Nabokov wrote a poem named \"Lilith\" (Лилит), which depicts an adult man engaging in sexual acts with a child whom he is sexually attracted to, before she pushes him off, leaving him feeling humiliated.[63] In 1939, he wrote a novella, Volshebnik (Волшебник), that was published only posthumously in 1986 in English translation as The Enchanter. It bears many similarities to Lolita, but also has significant differences: it takes place in Central Europe, and the protagonist is unable to consummate his passion with his stepdaughter, leading to his suicide. The theme of hebephilia was already touched on by Nabokov in his short story \"A Nursery Tale\", written in 1926.[64] Also, in the 1932 novel Laughter in the Dark, Margot Peters is 16 and has already had an affair when the middle-aged Albinus becomes attracted to her.In chapter three of the novel The Gift (written in Russian in 1935–37), the similar gist of Lolita's first chapter is outlined to the protagonist, Fyodor Cherdyntsev, by his landlord Shchyogolev as an idea of a novel he would write \"if I only had the time\": a man marries a widow only to gain access to her young daughter, who resists all his passes. Shchyogolev says it happened \"in reality\" to a friend of his; it is made clear to the reader that it concerns himself and his stepdaughter Zina (15 at the time of Shchyogolev's marriage to her mother), who becomes the love of Fyodor's life.In April 1947, Nabokov wrote to Edmund Wilson: \"I am writing ... a short novel about a man who liked little girls—and it's going to be called The Kingdom by the Sea.\"[65] The work expanded into Lolita during the next eight years. Nabokov used the title A Kingdom by the Sea in his 1974 pseudo-autobiographical novel Look at the Harlequins! for a Lolita-like book written by the narrator who, in addition, travels with his teenage daughter Bel from motel to motel after the death of her mother; later, his fourth wife is Bel's look-alike and shares her birthday.In Nabokov's 1962 novel Pale Fire, the titular poem by fictional John Shade mentions Hurricane Lolita coming up the American east coast in 1958, and narrator Charles Kinbote (in the commentary later in the book) notes it, questioning why anyone would have chosen an obscure Spanish nickname for a hurricane. There were no hurricanes named Lolita that year, but that is the year that Lolita was published in North America.The unfinished novel The Original of Laura, published posthumously, features the character Hubert H. Hubert, an older man preying upon the then-child protagonist, Flora. Unlike those of Humbert Humbert in Lolita, Hubert's advances are unsuccessful.Literary pastiches, allusions and prototypes\n[edit]The novel abounds in allusions to classical and modern literature. Virtually all of them have been noted in The Annotated Lolita, edited and annotated by Alfred Appel Jr. Many are references to Humbert's own favorite poet, Edgar Allan Poe.Humbert's first love, Annabel Leigh, is named after the \"maiden\" in the poem \"Annabel Lee\" by Poe; this poem is alluded to many times in the novel, and its lines are borrowed to describe Humbert's love. A passage in chapter 11 reuses verbatim Poe's phrase \"...by the side of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride\".[66] In the opening of the novel, the phrase \"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied,\" is a pastiche of two passages of the poem, the \"winged seraphs of heaven\" (line 11), and \"The angels, not half so happy in heaven, went envying her and me\" (lines 21–22).[67] Nabokov originally intended Lolita to be called The Kingdom by the Sea,[68] drawing on the rhyme with Annabel Lee that was used in the first verse of Poe's work. A variant of this line is reprised in the opening of chapter one, which reads \"...had I not loved, one summer, an initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea\".[67]Humbert Humbert's double name recalls Poe's \"William Wilson\", a tale in which the main character is haunted by his doppelgänger, paralleling the presence of Humbert's own doppelgänger, Clare Quilty. Humbert is not, however, his real name, but a chosen pseudonym. The theme of the doppelgänger also occurs in Nabokov's earlier novel, Despair.Chapter 26 of Part One contains a parody of Joyce's stream of consciousness.[69]Humbert's field of expertise is French literature (one of his jobs is writing a series of educational works that compare French writers to English writers), and as such there are several references to French literature, including the authors Gustave Flaubert, Marcel Proust, François Rabelais, Charles Baudelaire, Prosper Mérimée, Rémy Belleau, Honoré de Balzac, and Pierre de Ronsard.Nabokov was fond of the works of Lewis Carroll, and had translated Alice in Wonderland into Russian. He even called Carroll the \"first Humbert Humbert\".[70]Lolita contains a few brief allusions in the text to the Alice books, though overall Nabokov avoided direct allusions to Carroll. In her book, Tramp: The Life of Charlie Chaplin, Joyce Milton claims that a major inspiration for the novel was Charlie Chaplin's relationship with his second wife, Lita Grey, whose real name was Lillita and is often misstated as Lolita. Graham Vickers in his book Chasing Lolita: How Popular Culture Corrupted Nabokov's Little Girl All Over Again argues that the two major real-world predecessors of Humbert are Lewis Carroll and Charlie Chaplin. Although Appel's comprehensive Annotated Lolita contains no references to Charlie Chaplin, others have picked up several oblique references to Chaplin's life in Nabokov's book. Bill Delaney notes that at the end Lolita and her husband move to the fictional Alaskan town of \"Gray Star\" while Chaplin's The Gold Rush, set in Alaska, was originally set to star Lita Grey. Lolita's first sexual encounter was with a boy named Charlie Holmes, whom Humbert describes as \"the silent ... but indefatigable Charlie\". Chaplin had an artist paint Lita Grey in imitation of Joshua Reynolds's painting The Age of Innocence. When Humbert visits Lolita in a class at her school, he notes a print of the same painting in the classroom. Delaney's article notes many other parallels as well.[71]The foreword refers to \"the monumental decision rendered December 6, 1933 by Hon. John M. Woolsey in regard to another, considerably more outspoken book\"—that is, the decision in the case United States v. One Book Called Ulysses, in which Woolsey ruled that Joyce's Ulysses was not obscene and could be sold in the United States.In chapter 29 of Part Two, Humbert comments that Lolita looks \"like Botticelli's russet Venus—the same soft nose, the same blurred beauty,\" referencing Sandro Botticelli's depiction of Venus in, perhaps, The Birth of Venus or Venus and Mars.In chapter 35 of Part Two, Humbert's \"death sentence\" on Quilty parodies the rhythm and use of anaphora in T. S. Eliot's poem Ash Wednesday.Many other references to classical and Romantic literature abound, including references to Lord Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and to the poetry of Laurence Sterne.Other possible real-life prototypes\n[edit]In addition to the possible prototypes of Lewis Carroll and Charlie Chaplin, Alexander Dolinin suggests[72] that the prototype of Lolita was 11-year-old Florence Horner, kidnapped in 1948 by 50-year-old mechanic Frank La Salle, who had caught her stealing a five-cent notebook. La Salle traveled with her over various states for 21 months and is believed to have raped her. He claimed that he was an FBI agent and threatened to \"turn her in\" for the theft and to send her to \"a place for girls like you\". The Horner case was not widely reported, but Dolinin notes various similarities in events and descriptions.While Nabokov had already used the same basic idea—that of a child molester and his victim booking into a hotel as father and daughter—in his then-unpublished 1939 work The Enchanter (Волшебник), he mentions the Horner case explicitly in Chapter 33 of Part II of Lolita: \"Had I done to Dolly, perhaps, what Frank Lasalle, a fifty-year-old mechanic, had done to eleven-year-old Sally Horner in 1948?\".[73]Heinz von Lichberg's \"Lolita\"\n[edit]German academic Michael Maar's book The Two Lolitas[74] describes his discovery of a 1916 German short story titled \"Lolita\" whose middle-aged narrator describes travelling abroad as a student. He takes a room as a lodger and instantly becomes obsessed with the preteen girl (also named Lolita) who lives in the same house. Maar has speculated that Nabokov may have had cryptomnesia (\"hidden memory\") while he was composing Lolita during the 1950s. Maar says that until 1937 Nabokov lived in the same section of Berlin as the author, Heinz von Eschwege (pen name: Heinz von Lichberg), and was most likely familiar with his work, which was widely available in Germany during Nabokov's time there.[75][76]The Philadelphia Inquirer, in the article \"Lolita at 50: Did Nabokov take literary liberties?\" says that, according to Maar, accusations of plagiarism should not apply and quotes him as saying: \"Literature has always been a huge crucible in which familiar themes are continually recast... Nothing of what we admire in Lolita is already to be found in the tale; the former is in no way deducible from the latter.\"[77] See also Jonathan Lethem's essay \"The Ecstasy of Influence: A Plagiarism\" in Harper's Magazine on this story.[78]Afterword\n[edit]In 1956, Nabokov wrote an afterword to Lolita (\"On a Book Entitled Lolita\") that first appeared in the first U.S. edition and has appeared thereafter.[79]One of the first things Nabokov makes a point of saying is that, despite John Ray Jr.'s claim in the foreword, there is no moral to the story.[80]Nabokov adds that \"the initial shiver of inspiration [for Lolita] was somehow prompted by a newspaper story about an ape in the Jardin des plantes who, after months of coaxing by a scientist, produced the first drawing ever charcoaled by an animal: this sketch showed the bars of the poor creature's cage.\"[81] Neither the article nor the drawing has been recovered.In response to an American critic who characterized Lolita as the record of Nabokov's \"love affair with the romantic novel\", Nabokov writes that \"the substitution of 'English language' for 'romantic novel' would make this elegant formula more correct.\"[82]Nabokov concludes the afterword with a reference to his beloved first language, which he abandoned as a writer once he moved to the United States in 1940: \"My private tragedy, which cannot, and indeed should not, be anybody's concern, is that I had to abandon my natural idiom, my untrammeled, rich, and infinitely docile Russian language for a second-rate brand of English.\"[83]Estimation\n[edit]Nabokov rated the book highly. In an interview for BBC Television in 1962, he said:Over a year later, in an interview for Playboy, he said:In the same year, in an interview with Life, Nabokov was asked which of his writings had most pleased him. He answered:Russian translation\n[edit]The Russian translation includes a \"Postscriptum\"[87] in which Nabokov reconsiders his relationship with his native language. Referring to the afterword in the English edition, Nabokov states that only \"the scientific scrupulousness led me to preserve the last paragraph of the American afterword in the Russian text...\" He further explains that the \"story of this translation is the story of a disappointment. Alas, that 'wonderful Russian language' which, I imagined, still awaits me somewhere, which blooms like a faithful spring behind the locked gate to which I, after so many years, still possess the key, turned out to be non-existent, and there is nothing beyond that gate, except for some burned out stumps and hopeless autumnal emptiness, and the key in my hand looks rather like a lock pick.\"Lolita has been adapted as two films, a musical, four stage-plays, one completed opera, and two ballets. There is also Nabokov's unfilmed (and re-edited) screenplay, an uncompleted opera based on the work, and an \"imagined opera\" which combines elements of opera and dance.Derivative literary works\n[edit]Books\n[edit]Film\n[edit]Popular music\n[edit]^ Nabokov pronounced Humbert Humbert's name /ˈhʌmbɜːrt ˈhʌmbɜːrt/ (HUM-burt HUM-burt).[1]\n^ Booth conceived of fiction as a rhetorical relation between author and reader; he viewed \"fictional narratives not as autonomous objects but as acts of communication whose aesthetic qualities were intertwined with their ethical effects on individual readers\".[35]: 223 ^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}\"Vladimir Nabokov and Lionel Trilling discuss Lolita in 1958\".

Retrieved 31 August 2020. In Vladimir Nabokov's 1955 novel, Lolita, the character Lolita is a child who is sexually victimized by the book's narrator. The word Lolita has, however, strayed from its original referent, and has settled into the language as a term we define as 'a precociously seductive girl.'...The definition of Lolita reflects the fact that the word is used in contemporary writing without connotations of victimization.\n^ a b c d e f g h Riggan, William (1981).

{"title":"Heidi","author":"Johanna Spyri","published":1880,"fiction":true,"plot":"In the town of Domleschg lived two brothers. The older wasted the family fortune on drinking and gambling, while the younger ran away to serve in army of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in Naples. Years later, the younger brother returns with a son, Tobias. After Tobias completes an apprenticeship in Mels, father and son move to Dörfli ('small village' in Swiss German) in the municipality of Maienfeld. The villagers spread rumors about the father's life in Naples. The man becomes known as The Alm-Uncle, as he lives in seclusion on the mountain Alm. Two village girls, sisters Dete and Adelheid, befriend Tobias. Adelheid and Tobias marry and have a daughter, also named Adelheid but affectionately nicknamed Heidi. Soon after, Tobias is killed in a work accident and Adelheid dies of a fever. The Alm-Uncle holds this against God and becomes bitter.Heidi[6] is raised by her maternal grandmother and Dete in Maienfeld. Shortly after the grandmother's death, Dete is offered a job as a maid in the big city, and takes 5-year-old Heidi to live with the Alm-Uncle. He resents Heidi's arrival, but the girl's intelligence and cheerful yet unaffected demeanour soon earn his love. Heidi befriends her new neighbours: young Peter the goatherd, his mother Brigitte, and his blind maternal grandmother. With each season that passes, the mountaintop inhabitants, especially Peter and the grandmother, grow more attached to Heidi, and she to them. However, the grandfather refuses to allow Heidi to attend school, quarrelling with the local pastor and schoolmaster when they try to encourage him to do so, and Heidi is illiterate as a result.Three years later, Dete returns to take Heidi to Frankfurt to be a hired lady's companion to a wealthy girl named Klara Sesemann, who is unable to walk and regarded as an invalid. Klara is charmed by Heidi's simple friendliness and her descriptions of life on the Alm, and delights in all the funny mishaps brought about by Heidi's naïvety and lack of experience with city life, but the Sesemanns' strict housekeeper, Fräulein Rottenmeier, views the household disruptions as wanton misbehaviour, and places the free-spirited Heidi under more and more restraint, forbidding her to talk of the Alps or to cry for home. Soon, Heidi becomes terribly homesick for the Alm, and grows alarmingly pale and thin. Her one diversion is learning to read and write using a collection of Biblical stories, motivated by Klara's grandmother Frau Sesemann who shows her trust and affection, and encourages her to believe in God and to pray. Later Frau Sesemann gifts Heidi the book.Heidi's homesickness leads to episodes of sleepwalking where she goes downstairs and opens the front door, which the household initially takes as the work of ghosts. The family doctor recommends she be sent home before she becomes seriously ill. She gladly returns to the mountains laden with presents for her friends and the book from Frau Sesemann, but finds one of her greatest pleasures is reading hymns to Peter's blind grandmother, who can no longer do so for herself. Her faith in God speaks to something in the Alm-Uncle. One day Heidi reads to him \"The Prodigal Son\" from a book Frau Sesemann gave her. That night Alm-Uncle prays for the first time in years. He accompanies Heidi to church, and that winter takes accommodation in the village so that she can attend school.Heidi and Klara continue to keep in touch and exchange letters. A visit by the doctor to Heidi leads him to recommend that Klara visit Heidi, believing that the mountain environment and the wholesome companionship will do her good. Klara makes the journey the next season and spends a wonderful summer with Heidi, becoming stronger on goat's milk and fresh mountain air. Peter, jealous of Heidi's and Klara's friendship, pushes her empty wheelchair down the mountain. He is soon wracked with guilt about what he did and ultimately confesses to it. Without her wheelchair, Klara has no choice but to learn to walk; she attempts to do so and is gradually successful. Her grandmother and father are overcome with joy to see Klara walking again. The Sesemann family promises to provide permanent care for Heidi, if there ever comes a time when her grandfather is no longer able to do so.Thirteen English translations were done between 1882 and 1959, by British and American translators: Louise Brooks, Helen B. Dole, H.A. Melcon, Helene S. White, Marian Edwardes, Elisabeth P. Stork, Mabel Abbott, Philip Schuyler Allen, Shirley Watkins, M. Rosenbaum, Eileen Hall, and Joy Law.[7] As of 2010, only the Brooks, Edwardes and Hall translations are still in print.[8] The preface of the 1924 English translation was written by Adeline Zachert.[9]In April 2010, a Swiss scholar named Peter Otto Büttner, uncovered a book written in 1830 by German author Hermann Adam von Kamp entitled Adelaide: The Girl from the Alps (German: Adelaide, das Mädchen vom Alpengebirge).[10] The two stories share many similarities in plotline and imagery.[11] Spyri's biographer Regine Schindler said it was entirely possible that Spyri may have been familiar with the story, as she grew up in a literate household with many books.[citation needed]Film and television\n[edit]About 25 film or television productions of the original story have been made. The Heidi films were popular far and wide, becoming a huge hit, and the Japanese animated series became iconic in several countries around the world. The only incarnation of the Japanese-produced animated TV series to reach the English language was a dubbed feature-length compilation film using the most pivotal episodes of the television series, released on video in the United States in 1985.Versions of the story include:Two new separate upcoming German-language television productions were announced in 2025 in the context of the upcoming 200th birthday of Johanna Spyri in 2027.[24][25][26][27]TheatreA stage musical adaptation of Heidi with book and lyrics by Francois Toerien, music by Mynie Grové and additional lyrics by Esther von Waltsleben, premiered in South Africa at the Klein Karoo National Arts Festival in 2016. Directed by Toerien with musical direction by Dawid Boverhoff, the production starred Tobie Cronjé (Rottenmeier), Dawid Minnaar (Sesemann), Albert Maritz (Grandfather), Ilse Klink (Aunt Dete), Karli Heine (Heidi), Lynelle Kenned (Klara), Dean Balie (Peter), Jill Middlekop and Marlo Minnaar. Puppets for the production were created by Hansie Visagie.[28]A stage musical adaptation of Heidi of the Mountain (music and lyrics by Claude Watt, book by Claude and Margaret Watt) was performed in Sidney, BC, Canada by Mountain Dream Productions, premiering in 2007 at the Charlie White Theatre, and has been performed again several times since then.[29] The 2007 production starred Claude Watt (Grandfather), Margaret Watt (Rottenmeier), Rianne Craig (Heidi) and Katrina Brindle (Klara).Computer games\n[edit]There have been two Heidi computer games released for mobile devices, with the most recent being Heidi: Mountain Adventures. Both games are based on the Studio 100 TV series of 2015 and are aimed at young children, with educational elements and a series of mini-games.[30][31]Heidiland, named after the Heidi books, is an important tourist area in Switzerland, popular especially with Japanese and Korean tourists.[32]Maienfeld is the center of what is called Heidiland; one of the villages, formerly called Oberrofels,[33] is actually renamed \"Heididorf\".[34] Heidiland is located in an area called Bündner Herrschaft; it is criticized as being a \"laughable, infantile cliché\"[32] and \"a more vivid example of hyperreality\".[35]Literary\n[edit]Between 1933 and 1955, French publishing company Flammarion published a new edition of Heidi along with a series of new original sequels. Despite being all published under Johanna Spyri's name, this books were neither written nor endorsed by Spyri, but were adapted from her other works by her French translator, Charles Tritten in the 1930s and 1940s, many years after she died, while the last one was written by Nathalie Gala.[36][37][38][39] The series is composed of a total of 7 books, 2 translated from Spyri's works and 5 original. Only two of them were published in English.There are some major differences between the original Heidi and the Tritten sequels. These include:Film\n[edit]In 1990, screenwriters Weaver Webb and Fred & Mark Brogger, and director Christopher Leitch, produced Courage Mountain, starring Charlie Sheen and Juliette Caton as Heidi. Billed as a sequel to Spyri's story, the film is anachronistic in that it depicts Heidi as a teenager during World War I, despite the fact that the original novel (where Heidi is only five years old) was published in 1881.The book has been criticised for black-and-white character portrayals and an idealization of pastoral life.[44][page needed]In Japan, since its first Japanese translation in 1906, the book has been influential upon the general, stereotypical image of Switzerland for the Japanese, especially its tourists, many visiting the Heidi's Village park.^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}Heidi: her years of wandering and learning / translated from the german of Johanna Spyri by Louise Brooks: a story for children and those who love children.

{"title":"The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care","author":"Benjamin Spock","published":1946,"fiction":true,"plot":"The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care is arranged by topics corresponding to the child's age, ranging from infancy to teenage years. Drawn from his career as a pediatrician, Spock's advice is comprehensive, dealing with topics such as preparing for the baby, toilet training, school, illnesses, and \"special problems\" like \"separated parents\" and \"the fatherless child\".[15]Unlike leading child care experts prior to the 1940s, Spock supports flexibility in child-rearing, advising parents to treat each child as an individual. Drawing on his psychoanalytic training, he explains the behavior and motivations of children at each stage of growth, allowing parents to make their own decisions about how to raise their children. For example, Spock has an entire chapter devoted to \"The One-Year-Old,\" in which he explains that babies at this age like to explore the world around them. He then suggests ways to arrange the house and prevent accidents with a \"wandering baby.\"[16]Spock emphasizes that ultimately, the parents' \"natural loving care\" for their children is most important.[17] He reminds parents to have confidence in their abilities and to trust their common sense; his practice as a pediatrician had proven to him that parents' instincts were usually best.[18]During Spock's lifetime, seven editions of his book were published. Several co-authors have helped revise the book since the fifth edition. Since Spock's death in 1998, three more editions have been published.Each subsequent edition of the book brings medical information up-to-date. Other revisions have emerged to deal with contemporary social issues, such as daycare and gay parenting.[19]In the second edition, Spock emphasizes in several new chapters the importance of \"firm but gentle\" control of children.[20] He warns against self-demand feeding, a type of feeding that had become popular in the 1940s. Because parents were letting their baby dictate when he or she should be fed, some parents began indulging all of their child's desires, resulting in unregulated sleep schedules and a loss of control for the parents. Spock clarifies in his manual that while parents should respect their children, they also must ask for respect in return.[21]By the fourth edition, Spock adapts to society's shifting ideas of gender equality, especially after the rise of the women's liberation movement and concurrent feminist criticisms about sexism apparent in Baby and Child Care. Spock changed every pronoun for the baby, previously referred to only as \"he\", and discusses ways for parents to minimize gender stereotyping while raising a child.[22] He warns against praising girls only on their appearance and notes the sexism present in a household where girls learn to do housework while boys play outside. Spock also continues to expand on the role of fathers and acknowledges that parents should have an equal share in child-rearing responsibilities, while also both having the right to work.[23]In the seventh edition, Spock endorses a low-fat, plant-based diet for children due to rising trends in obesity and Spock's own switch to a macrobiotic diet after facing serious health issues.[24]Within a year of being published, The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care had already sold 750,000 copies, mostly by word-of-mouth advertising.[25] Mothers appreciated that Spock was not condescending in his writing, instead conveying empathy and acknowledging how tiresome child care can be.[3] Although he believed that much of a child's personality and behavior rested in the parents' hands, he did not scare parents with the large responsibility of raising a \"good\" child, like earlier child care experts had.[26] He was lauded for writing with a friendly, reassuring tone and using conversational, easy-to-read language.[27]Spock was popularized by mentions in household magazines and on famous television shows like I Love Lucy, where the characters Lucy and Ricky Ricardo were seen consulting Spock's manual in various episodes when seeking advice for raising their child.[25] Spock quickly became a household name in the 1950s, and is frequently credited for helping to raise a generation of \"Spock babies\" in the post-war period. Mothers relied heavily on his advice; by 1956, The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care was already selling a million copies each year.[28]In the mid-1960s, however, book sales slowed due to Spock's controversial support for protests against U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Spock faced backlash from conservative critics who accused him of condoning an overly \"permissive\" approach to parenting, and blamed his book for the youth rebellion and counterculture of the 1960s. Spock, however, continued to defend himself, saying he had always believed in firm leadership from parents.[29] Skepticism of his work also increased among colleagues, who criticized Spock for not being a serious academic researcher and relying too heavily on anecdotal evidence in his book.[30]In the 1970s, with the rise of the women's liberation movement, feminists began to publicly criticize Spock for the sexist assumptions that were apparent in his book. He was thus forced to confront his own ideas about gender roles and gender stereotyping.[22]Near the end of his life, Spock's changing ideas were reflected alongside technological and social changes in the seventh and final edition of his book.[31] His advocacy for a vegan diet drew criticism from some nutritionists and pediatricians, including co-author Dr. Steven J. Parker, as being too extreme.[32] Health and science columnist Jane Brody referenced the Pediatric Nutrition Handbook of the AAP in arguing that a vegan diet for young children could result in nutritional deficiencies unless carefully planned, something which would be difficult for working parents.[33]Baby and Child Care popularized new ideas about child care in the years following World War II, encouraging flexibility, common sense, affection, and Freudian philosophy. Spock's reassuring advice gave parents the confidence to use their best judgment to raise their children.[34] Spock also masked Freudian explanations of children's behavior in plainspoken language to avoid offending his readers, making Freud accessible to mainstream America.[35] In 1959, Look magazine praised Spock, noting that \"perhaps no other person has so influenced an entire nation's ideas about babies ... His views have brought naturalness, common sense, reassurance, Sigmund Freud and even joy to parents all over the world\".[36]Spock's optimistic book reflects the hopefulness of the post-war period and society's focus on children. Because post-war affluence helped parents give children more opportunities, parents became more concerned with providing the best for their children. At the same time, the widespread move to the suburbs broke up families, increasing parents' reliance on experts' advice over grandparents' advice.[37]Although Spock's reputation has changed over time, he continued to be a leading authority on child care until his death. In 1990, Life magazine named Spock one of the 100 most important people of the twentieth century.[38] Upon Spock's death in 1998, The New York Times noted that \"babies do not arrive with owner's manuals ... But for three generations of American parents, the next best thing was Baby and Child Care ... Dr. Benjamin Spock ... breathed humanity and common sense into child-rearing\".[39]Spock's book appears in the I Love Lucy episode \"Nursery School\", in which a passage about why nursery school is good for children is quoted. Lucy takes a sentence out of context to support her belief that Little Ricky shouldn't go to nursery school, but Ricky then quotes the rest of the passage, which supports his belief that their son should attend one.Spock's book also appears as a gag prop in the Coen brothers' film Raising Arizona and in the comedy-drama The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\n^ Thomas Maier, Dr. Spock: An American Life (New York: Basic Books, 2003), 462.\n^ Louise Hidalgo, \"Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care at 65,\" BBC World Service, 23 August 2011.\n^ a b Maier, 142.\n^ Benjamin Spock, The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care (New York: Duell, Sloan, and Pearce, 1946).\n^ John Watson, Psychological Care of Infant and Child, (New York: W.

{"title":"Anne of Green Gables","author":"Lucy Maud Montgomery","published":1908,"fiction":true,"plot":"Anne Shirley, a young orphan from the fictional community of Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia (based upon the real community of New London, Prince Edward Island),[16][17] is sent to live with Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, unmarried siblings in their fifties and sixties, after a childhood spent in strangers' homes and orphanages. Marilla and Matthew had originally sought to adopt a boy from the orphanage to help Matthew run their farm at Green Gables, which is set in the fictional town of Avonlea (based on Cavendish, Prince Edward Island). Through a misunderstanding, the orphanage sends Anne instead.Anne is fanciful, imaginative, eager to please, and dramatic. She is also adamant her name should always be spelled with an \"e\" at the end. However, she is defensive about her appearance, despising her red hair, freckles, and pale, thin frame, but liking her nose. She is talkative, especially when it comes to describing her fantasies and dreams. At first, stern Marilla says Anne must return to the orphanage, but after much observation and consideration, along with kind, quiet Matthew's encouragement, Marilla decides to let her stay.Anne takes much joy in life and adapts quickly, thriving in the close-knit farming village. Her imagination and talkativeness soon brighten up Green Gables.The book recounts Anne's struggles and joys in settling into Green Gables (the first real home she's ever known): the country school where she quickly excels in her studies; her friendship with Diana Barry, the girl living next door (her best or \"bosom friend\" as Anne fondly calls her); her budding literary ambitions; and her rivalry with her classmate Gilbert Blythe, who teases her about her red hair. For that, he earns her instant hatred, although he apologizes several times. As time passes, however, Anne realizes she no longer hates Gilbert, but her pride and stubbornness keep her from speaking to him.The book also follows Anne's adventures in Avonlea. Episodes include playtime with her friends Diana, calm, placid Jane Andrews, and beautiful, boy-crazy Ruby Gillis. She has run-ins with the unpleasant Pye sisters, Gertie and Josie, and frequent domestic \"scrapes\" such as dyeing her hair green while intending to dye it black, and accidentally getting Diana drunk by giving her what she thinks is raspberry cordial but which turns out to be currant wine.At sixteen, Anne goes to Queen's Academy to earn a teaching license, along with Gilbert, Ruby, Josie, Jane, and several other students, excluding Diana, much to Anne's dismay. She obtains her license in one year instead of the usual two and wins the Avery Scholarship awarded to the top student in English. This scholarship would allow her to pursue a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree at the fictional Redmond College (based on the real Dalhousie College) on the mainland in Nova Scotia.Near the end of the book, however, tragedy strikes when Matthew dies of a heart attack after learning that all of his and Marilla's money has been lost in a bank failure. Out of devotion to Marilla and Green Gables, Anne gives up the scholarship to stay at home and help Marilla, whose eyesight is failing. She plans to teach at the Carmody school, the nearest school available, and return to Green Gables on weekends. In an act of friendship, Gilbert Blythe gives up his teaching position at the Avonlea School in favor of Anne, to work at the White Sands School instead, knowing that Anne wants to stay close to Marilla after Matthew's death. After this kind act, Anne and Gilbert's friendship is cemented, and Anne looks forward to what life will bring next.The Green Gables household\n[edit]Anne's friends/classmates\n[edit]Avonlea's locals\n[edit]Others\n[edit]Anne of Green Gables was first published by L.C. Page & Co. of Boston on June 13, 1908.[18] The book quickly became a best-seller, selling over 19,000 copies in the first five months. Since then, over 50 million copies have been sold worldwide.[19] A full scan of the first edition, first impression is provided by the L. M. Montgomery Institute.Montgomery's original manuscript is preserved by the Confederation Centre of the Arts, in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Since 2022, the Centre has hosted a project in which digital images of the entire manuscript can be examined online. A transcript of the manuscript was published by Nimbus Publishing in 2019.Montgomery's original typescript and the corrected proofs are lost.[20]The first edition has errors in the text. Critical editions will identify corrections that have been applied to the text by the editor. The choice of corrections depends on the editor and varies across editions. As an example, the Penguin Classics edition,[21] edited by Benjamin Lefebvre, lists the following corrections:Based on the popularity of her first book, Montgomery wrote a series of sequels to continue the story of her heroine Anne Shirley.The prequel, Before Green Gables (2008), was written by Budge Wilson with the authorization of the heirs of L. M. Montgomery.The Green Gables farmhouse is located in Cavendish, Prince Edward Island. Many tourist attractions on Prince Edward Island have been developed based on the fictional Anne, and provincial license plates once bore her image.[22] Balsam Hollow, the forest that inspired the Haunted Woods and Campbell Pond, the body of water which inspired The Lake of Shining Waters, both described in the book, are located in the vicinity.[23] In addition, the Confederation Centre of the Arts has featured the wildly successful Anne of Green Gables musical on its mainstage every summer for over five decades.[24] The Anne of Green Gables Museum is located in Park Corner, PEI, in a home that inspired L. M. Montgomery.[25]The province and tourist facilities have highlighted the local connections to the internationally popular novels. Anne of Green Gables has been translated into 36 languages.[26][27] \"Tourism by Anne fans is an important part of the Island economy\".[28] Merchants offer items based on the novels.In 2019, Canadian publishing company Bradan Press crowdfunded a Scottish-Gaelic translation of Anne of Green Gables, titled Anna Ruadh, through the crowdfunding website Kickstarter. The book, released in 2020, is the first Scottish-Gaelic translation of Anne of Green Gables.[29][30]The novel has been popular in Japan, where it is known as Red-haired Anne (赤毛のアン (Akage no An)),[31][32] and where it has been included in the national school curriculum since 1952. 'Anne' is revered as \"an icon\" in Japan, especially since 1979 when this story was broadcast as anime, Anne of Green Gables. Japanese couples travel to Prince Edward Island to have civil wedding ceremonies on the grounds of the Green Gables farm. Some Japanese girls arrive as tourists with red-dyed hair styled in pigtails, to look like Anne.[33] In 2014, the Asadora 'Hanako to Anne', which was about Hanako Muraoka, the first person to translate Anne into Japanese, was broadcast and Anne became popular among old and young alike.A replica of the Green Gables house in Cavendish is located in the theme park Canadian World in Ashibetsu, Hokkaido, Japan. The park was a less expensive alternative for Japanese tourists instead of traveling to P.E.I. The park hosted performances featuring actresses playing Anne and Diana. The theme park is open during the summer season with free admission, though there are no longer staff or interpreters.[34]The Avonlea theme park near Cavendish and the Cavendish Figurines shop have trappings so that tourists may dress like the book's characters for photos.[35] Souvenir shops throughout Prince Edward Island offer numerous foods and products based on details of the 'Anne Shirley' novels. Straw hats for girls with sewn-in red braids are common, as are bottles of raspberry cordial soda.[36]Panorama of Green Gable farmhouse and grounds in CavendishEntrance to Anne of Green Gables Museum in Park CornerFilms\n[edit]The first filmed appearance of Anne Shirley was in the 1919 silent film, Anne of Green Gables, in which the role was played by Mary Miles Minter. The film was directed by William Desmond Taylor. As of 2011, no prints of this silent film adaptation are known to survive. The 1919 film version moved the story from Prince Edward Island to New England, which one American critic—unaware that the novel was set in Canada—praised for \"the genuine New England atmosphere called for by the story\".[46] Montgomery herself was infuriated with the film for changing Anne from a Canadian to an American, writing in her diary:Montgomery disapproved of Minter's performance, writing she had portrayed \"a sweet, sugary heroine utterly unlike my gingerly Anne\", and complained about a scene where Shirley waved about a shotgun as something that her Anne would never do.[47]In the 1934 adaptation of the novel, Anne was portrayed by Dawn O'Day, who legally changed her name to \"Anne Shirley.\" She reprised the role in Anne of Windy Poplars, a 1940 film adaptation. Montgomery liked the 1934 film more than the 1919 film, not least because now the book's dialogue could be portrayed on the silver screen and that two scenes were filmed on location in Prince Edward Island (though the rest of the film was shot in California), but still charged that neither the 1919 nor 1934 versions of Anne of Green Gables quite got her book right.[48] Writing about the 1934 version of Anne of Green Gables, Montgomery wrote in her diary that it was a \"thousand times\" better than the 1919 version, but still it: \"was so entirely different from my vision of the scenes and the people that it did not seem like my book at all\".[47] The British scholar Faye Hammill wrote that 1934 film version stripped Anne of the \"Canadian and feminist\" aspects that the Anne of the books possessed, stating that there was something about Anne that Hollywood cannot get right.[48] Hammill observed that the idea that Anne was entirely cheerful is a product of the film and television versions as the Anne of the books has to deal with loss, rejection, cruel authority figures, and loneliness.[48]List\n[edit]Radio productions\n[edit]Stage productions\n[edit]Television films and episodic series (animated)\n[edit]Television films and episodic series (live-action)\n[edit]Web productions\n[edit]Comics\n[edit]As one of the most familiar characters in Canadian literature, Anne of Green Gables has been parodied by several Canadian comedy troupes, including CODCO (Anne of Green Gut) and The Frantics (Fran of the Fundy).^ Benjamin Lefebvre, Textual Transformations in Children's Literature: Adaptations, Translations, Reconsiderations (2013), p. 132\n^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}Devereux, Cecily Margaret (2004).

{"title":"Black Beauty","author":"Anna Sewell","published":1877,"fiction":true,"plot":"The story is narrated in the first person as an autobiographical memoir told by the titular horse named Black Beauty—beginning with his carefree days as a foal on an English farm with his mother, known as Duchess, to his difficult life pulling cabs in London, to his happy retirement in the country. Along the way, he meets with many hardships and recounts many tales of cruelty and kindness. Each short chapter recounts an incident in Black Beauty's life containing a lesson or moral typically related to the kindness, sympathy, and understanding treatment of horses, with Sewell's detailed observations and extensive descriptions of horse behaviour lending the novel a good deal of verisimilitude.[1]The book describes conditions among London horse-drawn cab drivers, including the financial hardship caused to them by high licence fees and low, legally fixed fares. A page footnote in some editions says that soon after the book was published, the difference between 6-day cab licences (not allowed to trade on Sundays) and 7-day cab licences (allowed to trade on Sundays) was abolished and the cab licence fee was much reduced.Black Beauty is considered to be one of the first fictional animal autobiographies.[9] Originally meant to be informative literature read by adults on the norms of horse cruelty and preventions of these unjust acts, Black Beauty is now seen as a children's book.[10] Narrated by the main character, Black Beauty, the novel is read by thousands of children worldwide.[11]Sewell uses anthropomorphism in Black Beauty. The text advocates the fairer treatment of horses in Victorian England. The story is narrated from Black Beauty's perspective and resultantly readers arguably gained insight into how horses suffered through their use by human beings with restrictive technical objects like the \"bearing rein\" and \"blinkers\" as well as procedures like cutting off the tails of the horses. For instance, Ginger describes the physical effects of the \"bearing rein\" to Black Beauty, by stating, \"it is dreadful... your neck aching until you don't know how to bear it... its hurt my tongue and my jaw and the blood from my tongue covered the froth that kept flying from my lips\".[12] Tess Coslett highlights that Black Beauty's story is structured in a way that makes him similar to those he serves. The horses in the text have reactions as well as emotions and characteristics, like love and loyalty, which are similar to those of human beings. Coslett emphasizes that, while Black Beauty is not the first book written in the style of an animal autobiography, it is a novel that \"allows the reader to slide in and out of horse-consciousness, blurring the human/animal divide\".[13] Dwyer suggests that \"by the end of the nineteenth century the concern for animal welfare was often mediated by considerations of utility\", implying that these animals (horses) were seen to get the job done by any means rather than the approach that they could be demonizing the animal.[14][clarification needed]Published in 1877, in the last years of Anna Sewell's life, Black Beauty sold over 50 million copies worldwide in 50 different languages.[15] This different viewpoint sparked people's interest to speak for horses' well-being and implement legislation.[16] According to Sewell, providing information was her original goal of horse injustice.[1] Although the shift of perspectives was seen as good for some, it was also an issue to others including horse owners and people who sold such equipment for horses (equipment like blinders).[17] It has been alleged that Black Beauty was banned in some countries, e.g. South Africa, for containing the words \"Black\" and \"Beauty\" during its apartheid restrictions on African natives.[18] However, Claire Datnow, in her memoir Behind the Walled Garden of Apartheid: Growing up White in Segregated South Africa,[19] writes that this \"fact\" was a standing joke among her circle of friends, invented to make fun of the \"ignorance of the censors\"—the idea being that Black Beauty had been banned \"because the censors thought it referred to a black woman.\"Upon publication of the book, many readers related to the pain of the victimized horses, sympathized and ultimately wanted to see the introduction of reforms that would improve the well-being of horses. Two years after the release of the novel, one million copies of Black Beauty were in circulation in the United States.[20] In addition, animal rights activists would habitually distribute copies of the novel to horse drivers and to people in stables.[21] The depiction of the \"bearing rein\" in Black Beauty spurred so much outrage and empathy from readers that its use was not only abolished in Victorian England, but public interest in anti-cruelty legislation in the United States also grew significantly. The arguably detrimental social practices concerning the use of horses in Black Beauty inspired the development of legislation in various states that would condemn such abusive behaviours towards animals.[22] The impact of the novel is still very much recognized today. Writing in the Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare, Bernard Unti calls Black Beauty \"the most influential anti-cruelty novel of all time\".[23] Comparisons have also been made between Black Beauty and the most important social protest novel in the United States, Uncle Tom's Cabin, by Harriet Beecher Stowe, on account of the strong degree of outrage and protest action that both novels triggered in society.[22]HorsesBeauty's ownersPart 1Part 2Part 3Part 4The book has been adapted into film and television several times, including:Black Beauty was adapted for the stage in 2011 by playwright James Stone. The play was performed at the Broughton Hall Estate, North Yorkshire and Epsom Racecourse, Surrey. The production was a critical success and was performed around the UK in 2012.[28]^ a b c d Merriam-Webster (1995). \"Black Beauty\".

{"title":"The Name of the Rose","author":"Umberto Eco","published":1980,"fiction":true,"plot":"In 1327, Franciscan friar William of Baskerville and his assistant Adso of Melk arrive at a Benedictine abbey in Northern Italy to attend a theological disputation. The abbey is being used as neutral ground in a dispute between Pope John XXII and the Franciscans over the question of apostolic poverty. The monks of the abbey have recently been shaken by the suspicious death of one of their brothers, Adelmo of Otranto, and the abbot asks William (a former inquisitor) to investigate the incident. During his inquiries, William has a debate with one of the oldest monks in the abbey, Jorge of Burgos, about the permissibility of laughter, which Jorge regards as a threat to God's established order.The second day, another monk, Venantius of Salvemec, is found dead in a vat of pig's blood. He has black stains on his tongue and fingers, suggesting poison. William learns that Adelmo was part of a homosexual love triangle that also involved the librarian, Malachi of Hildesheim, and Malachi's assistant, Berengar of Arundel. The only other monks who knew about these indiscretions were Jorge and Venantius. In spite of Malachi's ban, William and Adso enter the abbey's labyrinthine library. They discover that the library contains a hidden room named the finis Africae after the presumed edge of the world, but they are unable to locate it. In the scriptorium, they find a book on Venantius's desk along with some cryptic notes. Someone snatches the book and they pursue to no avail.The third day, the monks are surprised by the disappearance of Berengar and William learns that there are two former Dulcinians in the abbey (Remigio of Voragine, the abbey's cellarer, and the deformed monk Salvatore). Adso returns to the library alone in the evening. While leaving the library through the kitchen, he encounters a peasant girl. Although they do not share a language, they have a sexual encounter, Adso's first. After confessing to William, Adso is absolved, although he still feels guilty.The fourth day, Berengar is found drowned in the abbey's bathhouse. His fingers and tongue bear stains similar to those found on Venantius. The pope's legation now arrives, led by Grand Inquisitor Bernard Gui. Salvatore is discovered attempting to cast a primitive love spell on the peasant girl, and Bernard arrests them both for witchcraft and heresy.The fifth day is the day of the disputation. Severinus, the abbey's herbalist, tells William that he has found a \"strange book\" that demands the friar's attention, but William is unable to investigate the discovery until the disputation has ended. When William and Adso arrive at Severinus's laboratory, they find him dead, his skull crushed by a heavy armillary sphere. They search the room for the missing book but are unable to locate it. Remigio is discovered at the scene of the crime and taken into custody by Bernard, who accuses the \"heretic\" of committing all four homicides. Under threat of torture, Remigio confesses. Remigio, Salvatore, and the peasant girl are taken away and assumed to be doomed. In response to the recent tragedies in the abbey, Jorge gives an apocalyptic sermon about the coming of the Antichrist.At matins the morning of the sixth day, Malachi drops dead, his fingers and tongue black. The abbot is distraught at William's failure to solve the crimes and orders him to leave the abbey the following day. That night, William and Adso penetrate the library once more and enter the finis Africae by solving Venantius's riddle. They discover Jorge waiting for them in the forbidden room. William has by now arrived at a solution. Berengar revealed the existence of the finis Africae to Adelmo in exchange for a sexual favour. Adelmo, stricken with guilt over this sinful bargain, then committed suicide. Venantius overheard the secret and used it to gain possession of a rare and valuable book that Jorge had hidden in the room. Unbeknownst to him, Jorge had laced its pages with poison, correctly assuming that a reader would have to lick his fingers in order to turn them. Venantius's body was discovered by Berengar, who, fearing exposure, disposed of it in pig's blood before claiming the book and succumbing to its poison. The book was next found by Severinus, but Jorge manipulated Malachi into killing him before he could pass it on to William. Malachi died after ignoring Jorge's warning not to investigate the book's contents. The book itself, now back in Jorge's possession, is the lost second half of Aristotle's Poetics, which discusses the virtues of laughter.Jorge confirms William's deductions and justifies himself by pointing to the fact that the deaths correspond to the seven trumpets described in the Book of Revelation, and therefore must form part of a divine plan. Two more deaths will complete the sequence: that of the abbot, whom Jorge has trapped in an airless passageway beneath the finis Africae, and that of Jorge himself. He begins consuming the book's poisoned pages and uses Adso's lantern to start a fire in the library.Adso summons the monks in a futile attempt to extinguish the fire. As the fire consumes the library and spreads to the rest of the abbey, William laments his failure. Confused and defeated, William and Adso escape the abbey. Years later, Adso, now aged, returns to the ruins of the abbey and salvages any remaining scraps and fragments, eventually creating a lesser library.Primary characters\n[edit]At the monastery\n[edit]Outsiders\n[edit]Eco was a professor of semiotics, and employed techniques of metanarrative, partial fictionalization, and linguistic ambiguity to create a world enriched by layers of meaning. The solution to the central murder mystery hinges on the contents of Aristotle's book on Comedy, which has been lost. In spite of this, Eco speculates on the content and has the characters react to it. Through the motif of this lost and possibly suppressed book which might have aestheticized the farcical, the unheroic and the skeptical, Eco also makes an ironically slanted plea for tolerance and against dogmatic or self-sufficient metaphysical truths – an angle which reaches the surface in the final chapters.[3] In this regard, the conclusion mimics a novel of ideas, with William representing rationality, investigation, logical deduction, empiricism and also the beauty of the human minds, against Jorge's dogmatism, censoriousness, and pursuit of keeping, no matter the cost, the secrets of the library closed and hidden to the outside world, including the other monks of the abbey.The Name of the Rose has been described as a work of postmodernism.[4] The quote in the novel, \"books always speak of other books, and every story tells a story that has already been told\", refers to a postmodern idea that all texts perpetually refer to other texts, rather than external reality, while also harkening back to the medieval notion that citation and quotation of books was inherently necessary to write new stories. The novel ends with irony: as Eco explains in his Postscript to the Name of the Rose, \"very little is discovered and the detective is defeated.\"[5] After unraveling the central mystery in part through coincidence and error, William of Baskerville concludes in fatigue that there \"was no pattern.\" Thus Eco turns the modernist quest for finality, certainty and meaning on its head, leaving the nominal plot—that of a detective story—broken, the series of deaths following a chaotic pattern of multiple causes, accident, and arguably without inherent meaning.[4]The mystery revolves around the abbey library, situated in a fortified tower—the aedificium. This structure has three floors—the ground floor contains the kitchen and refectory, the first floor a scriptorium, and the top floor is occupied by the library.[6] The two lower floors are open to all, while only the librarian may enter the last. A catalogue of books is kept in the scriptorium, where manuscripts are read and copied. A monk who wishes to read a book would send a request to the librarian, who, if he thought the request justified, would bring it to the scriptorium. Finally, the library is in the form of a labyrinth, whose secret only the librarian and the assistant librarian know.[7]The aedificium has four towers at the four cardinal points, and the top floor of each has seven rooms on the outside, surrounding a central room. There are another eight rooms on the outer walls, and sixteen rooms in the centre of the maze. Thus, the library has a total of fifty-six rooms.[8] Each room has a scroll containing a verse from the Book of Revelation. The first letter of the verse is the letter corresponding to that room.[9] The letters of adjacent rooms, read together, give the name of a region (e.g. Hibernia in the West tower), and those rooms contain books from that region. The geographical regions are:Two rooms have no lettering – the easternmost room, which has an altar, and the central room on the south tower, the so-called finis Africae, which contains the most heavily guarded books, and can only be entered through a secret door. The entrance to the library is in the central room of the east tower, which is connected to the scriptorium by a staircase.[10]Much attention has been paid to the mystery of what the book's title refers to. In fact, Eco has stated that his intention was to find a \"totally neutral title\".[5] In one version of the story, when he had finished writing the novel, Eco hurriedly suggested some ten names for it and asked a few of his friends to choose one. They chose The Name of the Rose.[11] In another version of the story, Eco had wanted the neutral title Adso of Melk, but that was vetoed by his publisher, and then the title The Name of the Rose \"came to me virtually by chance.\" In the Postscript to the Name of the Rose, Eco claims to have chosen the title \"because the rose is a symbolic figure so rich in meanings that by now it hardly has any meaning left\".[5]The book's last line, \"Stat rosa pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus\" translates as: \"the rose of old remains only in its name; we possess naked names.\" The general sense, as Eco pointed out,[12] was that from the beauty of the past, now disappeared, we hold only the name. In this novel, the lost \"rose\" could be seen as Aristotle's book on comedy (this part of his Poetics is now forever lost[13]), the exquisite library now destroyed, or the beautiful peasant girl now dead.This text has also been translated as \"Yesterday's rose stands only in name, we hold only empty names.\" This line is a verse by the twelfth-century monk Bernard of Cluny (also known as Bernard of Morlaix). Medieval manuscripts of this line are not in agreement: Eco quotes one Medieval variant verbatim,[14] but Eco was not aware at the time of the text more commonly printed in modern editions, in which the reference is to Rome (Roma), not to a rose (rosa).[15] The alternative text, with its context, runs: Nunc ubi Regulus aut ubi Romulus aut ubi Remus? / Stat Roma pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus. This translates as \"Where now is Regulus, or Romulus, or Remus? / Primordial Rome abides only in its name; we hold only naked names\".[16]The title may also be an allusion to the nominalist position in the problem of universals, taken by William of Ockham. According to nominalism, universals are bare names: there is not a universal rose, only a bunch of particular flowers that we artificially singled out by naming them \"roses\".[citation needed]A further possible inspiration for the title may be a poem by the Mexican poet and mystic Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (1651–1695):This poem appears in Eco's Postscript to the Name of the Rose, and is translated into English in \"Note 1\" of that book as:To other works\n[edit]The name of the central character, William of Baskerville, alludes both to the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes (compare The Hound of the Baskervilles – also, Adso's description of William in the beginning of the book resembles, almost word for word, Dr. Watson's description of Sherlock Holmes when he first makes his acquaintance in A Study in Scarlet) and to William of Ockham (see the next section). The name of the novice, Adso of Melk, refers to Melk Abbey in Austria, the site of a famous medieval library. Further, his name echoes the narrator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, Watson (omitting the first and last letters).[17]The blind librarian Jorge of Burgos is a nod to Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, a major influence on Eco. Borges was blind during his later years and was also director of Argentina's national library; his short story \"The Library of Babel\" is an inspiration for the secret library in Eco's book.[18] Another of Borges's stories, \"The Secret Miracle\", features a blind librarian. In addition, a number of other themes drawn from various of Borges's works are used throughout The Name of the Rose: labyrinths, mirrors, sects, and obscure manuscripts and books.The ending also owes a debt to Borges's short story \"Death and the Compass\", in which a detective proposes a theory for the behaviour of a murderer. The murderer learns of the theory and uses it to trap the detective. In The Name of the Rose, the librarian Jorge uses William's belief that the murders are based on the Revelation to John to misdirect William, though in Eco's tale, the detective succeeds in solving the crime.The \"poisoned page\" motif may have been inspired by Alexandre Dumas' novel La Reine Margot (1845). It was also used in the film Il giovedì (1963) by Italian director Dino Risi.[19] A similar story is associated with the Chinese erotic novel Jin Ping Mei, translated as The Golden Lotus or The Plum in the Golden Vase.Eco seems also to have been aware of Rudyard Kipling's short story \"The Eye of Allah\", which touches on many of the same themes, like optics, manuscript illumination, music, medicine, priestly authority and the Church's attitude to scientific discovery and independent thought, and which also includes a character named John of Burgos.Eco was also inspired by the 19th-century Italian novelist Alessandro Manzoni, citing The Betrothed as an example of the specific type of historical novel he purposed to create, in which some of the characters may be made up, but their motivations and actions remain authentic to the period and render history more comprehensible.[20]Throughout the book, there are Latin quotes, authentic and apocryphal. There are also discussions of the philosophy of Aristotle and of a variety of millenarist heresies, especially those associated with the fraticelli. Numerous other philosophers are referenced throughout the book, often anachronistically, including Wittgenstein.To actual history and geography\n[edit]The book describes monastic life in the 14th century. The action takes place at a Benedictine abbey during the controversy surrounding the doctrines about absolute poverty of Christ and apostolic poverty between branches of Franciscans and Dominicans; (see renewed controversy on the question of poverty). The setting was inspired by monumental Saint Michael's Abbey in Susa Valley, Piedmont and visited by Umberto Eco.[21][22]The book highlights tensions that existed within Christianity during the medieval era: the Spirituals, one faction within the Franciscan order, demanded that the Church should abandon all wealth, and some heretical sects, such as the Dulcinians, began killing the well-to-do, while the majority of the Franciscans and the clergy took to a broader interpretation of the gospel. Also in the background is the conflict between Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV and Pope John XXII, with the Pope condemning the Spirituals and the Emperor supporting them as proxies in a larger power struggle at the time over authorities claimed by both the Church and Empire.[23] The novel takes place during the Avignon Papacy and in his Prologue, Adso mentions the election of anti-king Frederick of Austria as a rival claimant to Emperor Louis thirteen years before the story begins.[24] Adso's \"Last Page\" epilogue describes the Emperor's appointment of Nicholas V as anti-Pope in Rome shortly after Louis IV abandoned reconciliation with John XXII (a decision Adso connects with the disastrous events of the novel's theological conference).[25]A number of the characters, such as Bernard Gui, Ubertino of Casale and the Franciscan Michael of Cesena, are historical figures, though Eco's characterization of them is not always historically accurate. His portrayal of Bernard Gui in particular has been widely criticized by historians as a caricature; Edward Peters has stated that the character is \"rather more sinister and notorious ... than he ever was historically\", and he and others have argued that the character is actually based on the grotesque portrayals of inquisitors and Catholic prelates more broadly in eighteenth and nineteenth-century Gothic literature, such as Matthew Gregory Lewis's The Monk (1796).[26][27] Additionally, part of the novel's dialogue is derived from Gui's inquisitor's manual, the Practica Inquisitionis Heretice Pravitatis. In the inquisition scene, the character of Gui asks the cellarer Remigius, \"What do you believe?\", to which Remigius replies, \"What do you believe, my Lord?\" Gui responds, \"I believe in all that the Creed teaches\", and Remigius tells him, \"So I believe, my Lord.\" Bernard then points out that Remigius is not claiming to believe in the Creed, but to believe that he, Gui, believes in the Creed; this is a paraphrased example from Gui's inquisitor's manual, used to warn inquisitors of the manipulative tendencies of heretics.[28]Adso's description of the portal of the monastery is recognizably that of the portal of the church at Moissac, France.[29]Dante Alighieri and his Comedy are mentioned once in passing. There is also a quick reference to a famous \"Umberto of Bologna\" – Umberto Eco himself.Dramatic works\n[edit]Films\n[edit]Graphic novels\n[edit]Games\n[edit]Music\n[edit]Television\n[edit]Some historical errors present are most likely part of the literary artifice, whose contextualization is documented in the pages of the book preceding the Prologue, in which the author states that the manuscript on which the current Italian translation was later carried out contained interpolations due to different authors from the Middle Ages to the Modern Era.[42] Eco also personally reported some errors and anachronisms present in various editions of the novel until the revision of 2011:Moreover, still present in the Note before the Prologue, in which Eco tries to place the liturgical and canonical hours:If it is assumed, as logical, that Eco referred to the local mean time, the estimate of the beginning of the hour before dawn and the beginning of Vespers (sunset), so those in the final lines (\"dawn and sunset around 7.30 and 4.40 in the afternoon\"), giving a duration from dawn to noon equal to or less than that from noon to dusk, is the opposite of what happens at the end of November (it is an incorrect application of the equation of time).^ a b Leinster, Ciarán (2025).

{"title":"The Eagle Has Landed","author":"Jack Higgins","published":1975,"fiction":true,"plot":"The book makes use of the false document technique, and opens with Higgins describing his discovery of the concealed grave of thirteen German paratroopers in an English graveyard. The characters discuss the historic rescue of Hitler's ally Benito Mussolini in September 1943. After Mussolini was deposed and imprisoned by the Italian government, Otto Skorzeny led a German team and achieved his release and escape from Italy.Adolf Hitler, with the strong support of Heinrich Himmler, considered a similar plan to kidnap the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, head of the Abwehr (German military intelligence), is ordered to make a feasibility study of capturing Churchill and taking him to the Reich. Canaris realises that although Hitler will soon forget the matter, Himmler will not. Fearing Himmler may try to discredit him, Canaris orders one of his officers, Oberst Radl, to undertake the study, despite feeling that it is all a waste of effort.An Unteroffizier on Radl's staff finds that one of their spies, codenamed Starling, has provided a tantalising piece of intelligence. \"At any other time, in any other place, this information would be useless,\" Radl said. \"And then synchronicity rears its disturbing head.\" Churchill is scheduled to spend a relaxing weekend at a country house near the village of Studley Constable, Norfolk, where Joanna Grey, an Afrikaner woman and longtime Abwehr agent, lives. She detests England because she was abused and raped by British soldiers, and her husband, daughter, and parents were killed during the Second Boer War. As a result of her reports, Radl devises a detailed plan to intercept Churchill and transport him to Germany. Although Radl is certain the plan has real possibilities, Admiral Canaris orders him to abandon it.Himmler, however, has already learned of the scheme and summons Radl. He orders him to proceed, but without informing Canaris. In response, Radl arranges for Liam Devlin, a member of the Irish Republican Army[2] who served as an officer in the Lincoln Battalion in the Spanish Civil War,[3] to be smuggled to Norfolk by way of Northern Ireland. Posing as a wounded veteran of the British Army, he contacts Mrs. Grey, who arranges a position for him as gamekeeper to the estate of Studley Grange. While awaiting further developments, Devlin becomes romantically involved with Molly Prior, a girl from the village.Meanwhile, Radl selects the members of the \"commando style\" unit, to be led by disgraced Fallschirmjäger commander Lieutenant Colonel Kurt Steiner, which is supposed to carry out the operation.[4] While returning from the Eastern Front, Steiner had intervened when SS soldiers were rounding up Jews at a railway station in Poland. To the outrage of the SS and Polizei, he took one of their men hostage and helped a teenage Jewish girl to escape on a passing freight train. For this he was court-martialled, along with his men, who backed his actions. Too highly decorated to face a firing squad, Steiner and his men were allowed to transfer to a penal unit in the Channel Islands. There they are forced to make high-risk attacks with human torpedoes against Allied ships in the English Channel.Radl travels to Alderney and recruits Steiner and his surviving men. Steiner's father, General Steiner, is being tortured by the Gestapo for his alleged ties to the German Resistance. This serves as an additional incentive for the Colonel to accept the mission. Radl relocates Steiner and his men to an airfield on the north western coast of Holland, where they familiarise themselves with the British weapons and equipment they will be using. The team will be air-dropped into Norfolk from a captured C-47 Dakota with Allied markings. The commandos outfit themselves as Free Polish paratroopers, as few of them speak English; the plan is to infiltrate Studley Constable, capture Churchill, rendezvous with an E-boat at the nearby coast, and make their escape. As part of the ruse, they arm themselves with Sten guns, M1 Garands, Bren guns and revolvers, as well as Browning Hi-Powers, instead of German weaponry.At first, the plan seems to go off without a hitch. But one of Steiner's NCOs rescues a young girl who fell into a mill race. He is killed by the water wheel and his German uniform (worn under the Polish uniforms, as protection against being executed as spies) is seen by several of the villagers. Determined to continue the mission, Steiner arranges for the locals to be rounded up, but the sister of Father Vereker, the local priest, escapes and alerts a nearby unit of US Army Rangers. Colonel Robert Shafto, an inexperienced but glory-seeking officer, rallies his forces to retake the hostages. Without notifying headquarters, he orders a foolhardy assault in which many Americans are killed. After the Colonel is shot in the head by Mrs. Grey, Major Harry Kane, Shafto's Executive officer in the Rangers,[5] organises a second, successful attack.Steiner, his second-in-command Ritter von Neumann, and Devlin escape with Molly's aid. Determined to finish the mission, Steiner allows Devlin and Neumann to escape without him and decides to make one last attempt at Churchill. He succeeds in reaching Churchill, but hesitates, is shot and supposedly killed. (However, Steiner reappears alive in The Eagle Has Flown, a quasi-sequel.) In Germany, Radl has had a heart attack, implied to be fatal. At about the same time, Himmler, upon discovering that the mission has failed, orders Radl's arrest for high treason.This account is surrounded by a frame story with a prologue and epilogue, a technique that Higgins uses in other of his novels. The author, whilst doing historical research in Norfolk, supposedly meets various surviving characters.The final revelation comes from an aged and terminally ill Father Vereker: at the time of his supposed visit to Norfolk, Churchill was en route to the Tehran Conference. The \"Churchill\" whom Steiner nearly killed was an impersonator, meaning that even if Steiner had fatally shot the man, the government would not have been affected.This book rapidly became a bestseller. As of 2010, it has sold more than 50 million copies.[7]The film rights were purchased and an adaptation was quickly prepared. In 1976, a British film of the same name was released, the last film directed by John Sturges. It starred Michael Caine, Donald Sutherland, Jenny Agutter, and Robert Duvall.[8] Its success also stimulated more book sales.Higgins wrote a sequel called The Eagle Has Flown, which was published in 1991. It was also set during World War II.Higgins featured his character of Liam Devlin in several later thrillers. He is older and acts as a mentor to Sean Dillon and Martin Brosnan. In Higgins' novel Confessional (1985), Devlin allies with MI6 to prevent a rogue KGB assassin from murdering Pope John Paul II.[citation needed]^ \"The Eagle Has Landed\".

{"title":"Watership Down","author":"Richard Adams","published":1972,"fiction":true,"plot":"Part 1: The Journey\n[edit]In the Sandleford warren, Fiver, a runty young rabbit who is a seer, receives a frightening vision of his warren's imminent destruction.[22][b] He and his brother Hazel fail to convince the Threarah, their Chief Rabbit, of the need to evacuate; they then try to convince the other rabbits, but only succeed in gaining nine followers, all bucks (males) and no does (females). Captain Holly of the Sandleford Owsla, the warren's military caste, accuses the group of fomenting dissension against the Threarah. He tries to stop them from leaving, but is driven off.Once out in the world, the traveling group of rabbits finds itself following the leadership of Hazel, who had been considered an unimportant member of the warren. The group travels far through dangerous territory. Bigwig and Silver, both former Owsla and the strongest rabbits among them, protect the others, helped by Hazel's good judgement and the ingenuity of the clever rabbit Blackberry. Along the way, they cross the River Enborne, and evade a badger, a dog, a crow, and a car. Hazel and Bigwig also stop three rabbits from attempting to return to the Sandleford warren.A rabbit named Cowslip invites Hazel's group to join his warren, where a farmer leaves food for the rabbits and shoots all the predators. Fiver senses death and deception in Cowslip's warren, but the rest of Hazel's group, enjoying the peace and good food, decide to ignore Fiver's warnings and the strange and evasive behaviour of the stranger rabbits. Later, Bigwig is caught in a snare, only surviving the ordeal thanks to Blackberry and Hazel's quick thinking. Deducing the truth, Fiver admonishes the rest in a wild lecture; the farmer feeds and protects the rabbits so he can harvest them for meat and skins, and Cowslip's rabbits invited the guests into their warren to increase their own odds of survival. The Sandleford rabbits, badly shaken, continue on their journey. They are joined by Strawberry, a buck who deserts Cowslip's warren.Part 2: On Watership Down\n[edit]Fiver's visions instruct the rabbits to seek a home atop the hills. The group eventually finds and settles in a beech hanger (a wooded hill) on Watership Down. While digging the new warren, they are joined by Captain Holly and his friend Bluebell. Holly is severely wounded, and both rabbits are ill from exhaustion, having escaped both the violent destruction of the Sandleford Warren by humans and an attack by Cowslip's rabbits along the way. Holly's ordeal has left him a changed rabbit and, after telling the others that Fiver's terrible vision has come true, he offers to join Hazel's band in whatever way they will have him.Although Watership Down is a peaceful habitat, Hazel realizes that, with all buck rabbits and no does, the warren will soon die out. With the help of their useful new friend, a black-headed gull named Kehaar, they discover a nearby warren called Efrafa, which is overcrowded. At Hazel's request, Holly leads a small embassy to Efrafa to present their request for does.Hazel and Pipkin (the smallest rabbit) decide to scout out the nearby Nuthanger Farm, where they find a rabbit hutch. Despite their uncertainty about living wild, the four hutch rabbits are willing to come to Watership. Two nights later, Hazel leads a raid on the farm, which frees two does and a buck from the hutch. Hazel is wounded in the leg by the farmer's shotgun and presumed dead; Fiver's visions prompt him and Blackberry to return and rescue Hazel. When the embassy to Efrafa returns soon after, Hazel and his rabbits learn that Efrafa is a police state run by the despotic General Woundwort, who refuses to allow anyone to leave his warren. Holly and his three companions have managed to escape with little more than their lives.Part 3: Efrafa\n[edit]While they were imprisoned in Efrafa, Holly's group had met an Efrafan doe named Hyzenthlay, who wishes to leave the warren and can recruit other does to join in the escape. Hazel and Blackberry devise a plan to rescue Hyzenthlay's group and bring them to Watership Down.Bigwig infiltrates Efrafa in the guise of a 'hlessi' (a wandering rabbit unattached to any warren). He is recruited into the Efrafan Owsla by Woundwort, while Hazel and several other Watership rabbits hide across the nearby River Test. With help from Kehaar, Bigwig manages to free Hyzenthlay and nine other does, as well as a condemned Efrafan prisoner named Blackavar. Woundwort and his officers pursue them, but the Watership rabbits and the escapees use a punt to float away down the Test and escape.Part 4: Hazel-rah\n[edit]Downriver, the punt strikes a bridge, killing one doe. Once the rabbits are back on shore, they begin the long journey home, losing one more doe to a fox along the way. As they near Watership, they come across Captain Campion and his Efrafan patrol, who have been tracking them. Blackavar advises Hazel that the patrol must be killed to prevent them from reporting to Woundwort, but Hazel spares them and sends them off.A few weeks later, the Owsla of Efrafa, led by Woundwort, unexpectedly arrives to destroy the warren at Watership Down and take back the escapees. Fiver experiences another vision, which gives Hazel the solution to the problem. While Bigwig fights and injures Woundwort in a narrow tunnel, preventing the rest of the Efrafans from getting any further into the burrows, Hazel, Dandelion and Blackberry return to Nuthanger Farm. They release Bob, the farmer's Labrador, and lure him back to Watership Down. Bob attacks the Efrafans, who flee in terror, leaving Woundwort to stubbornly stand his ground unobserved. Following the fight, Bob returns to Nuthanger Farm with a few wounds, but there is no sign of Woundwort's body. Groundsel, one of the Efrafan officers, fervently believes the General must have survived.After releasing Bob, Hazel is attacked by Tab, one of the farmhouse cats. He is saved by young Lucy, the former owner of the escaped hutch rabbits, who shows him to the local doctor before releasing him. Upon returning to Watership, Hazel effects a lasting peace and friendship between the remaining Efrafans and the Watership rabbits. Some time later, Hazel and Campion, the intelligent new chief of Efrafa, send rabbits to start a new warren at Caesar's Belt, to relieve the effects of overcrowding at both their warrens.Epilogue\n[edit]As time goes on, the three warrens on the downs prosper under Hazel, Campion and Groundsel (their respective chiefs). General Woundwort is never seen or heard from again; he becomes a legend among the rabbits, and a sort of bogeyman to frighten rabbit kits. Kehaar rejoins his colony, but continues to visit the rabbits every winter. He refuses to search for Woundwort, showing that even he still fears him.Years later, on a cold March morning, an elderly Hazel is visited by El-ahrairah, the legendary rabbit folk hero and spiritual Prince of the Rabbits. He invites Hazel to join his Owsla, reassuring Hazel of Watership's future success and prosperity. Leaving his friends and his physical body behind, Hazel departs Watership Down with El-ahrairah.Rabbits\n[edit]Non-rabbits\n[edit]Mythical characters\n[edit]Main article: Lapine language\"Lapine\" is a fictional language created by author Richard Adams for the novel, where it is spoken by the rabbit characters. The language was again used in Adams's 1996 sequel, Tales from Watership Down, and has appeared in both the film and television adaptations. The language fragments in the books consist of a few dozen distinct words, used mainly for the naming of rabbits, their mythological characters, and objects in their world. The name \"Lapine\" comes from the French word for rabbit.[25][26]Watership Down has been described as an allegory, with the labours of Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig, and Silver \"mirror[ing] the timeless struggles between tyranny and freedom, reason and blind emotion, and the individual and the corporate state.\"[27] Adams draws on classical heroic and quest themes from Homer and Virgil, creating a story with epic motifs.[28]The Hero, the Odyssey, and the Aeneid\n[edit]The book explores the themes of exile, survival, heroism, leadership, political responsibility, and the \"making of a hero and a community\".[29] Joan Bridgman's analysis of Adams's works in The Contemporary Review identifies the community and hero motifs: \"[T]he hero's journey into a realm of terrors to bring back some boon to save himself and his people\" is a powerful element in Adams's tale. This theme derives from the author's exposure to the works of mythologist Joseph Campbell, especially his study of comparative mythology, The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949), and in particular, Campbell's \"monomyth\" theory, also based on Carl Jung's view of the unconscious mind, that \"all the stories in the world are really one story.\"[28]The concept of the hero has invited comparisons between Watership Down's characters and those in Homer's Odyssey and Virgil's Aeneid.[27] Hazel's courage, Bigwig's strength, Blackberry's ingenuity and craftiness, and Dandelion's and Bluebell's poetry and storytelling all have parallels in the epic poem Odyssey.[30] Kenneth Kitchell declared, \"Hazel stands in the tradition of Odysseus, Aeneas, and others\".[31]Tolkien scholar John Rateliff calls Adams's novel an Aeneid \"what-if\" book: what if the seer Cassandra (Fiver) had been believed and she and a company had fled Troy (Sandleford Warren) before its destruction? What if Hazel and his companions, like Odysseus, encounter a seductive home at Cowslip's Warren (Land of the Lotus Eaters)? Rateliff goes on to compare the rabbits' battle with Woundwort's Efrafans to Aeneas's fight with Turnus's Latins. \"By basing his story on one of the most popular books of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, Adams taps into a very old myth: the flight from disaster, the heroic refugee in search of a new home, a story that was already over a thousand years old when Virgil told it in 19 BC.\"[5]Religious symbolism\n[edit]When asked in a 2007 BBC Radio interview about the religious symbolism in the novel, Adams said the story was \"nothing like that at all\". He said the rabbits in Watership Down did not worship; however, \"they believed passionately in El-ahrairah.\" Adams explained that he meant the book to be \"only a made-up story ... in no sense an allegory or parable or any kind of political myth. I simply wrote down a story I told to my little girls.\"[32] Instead, he explained, the \"let-in\" religious stories of El-ahrairah were meant more as legendary tales, similar to a rabbit Robin Hood, and these stories were interspersed throughout the book as humorous interjections to the often \"grim\" tales of the \"real story\".[33]The Economist heralded the book's publication, saying \"If there is no place for Watership Down in children's bookshops, then children's literature is dead.\"[34]Peter Prescott, senior book reviewer at Newsweek, gave the novel a glowing review: \"Adams handles his suspenseful narrative more dextrously than most authors who claim to write adventure novels, but his true achievement lies in the consistent, comprehensible and altogether enchanting civilisation that he has created.\"[29] Kathleen J. Rothen and Beverly Langston identified the work as one that \"subtly speaks to a child\", with \"engaging characters and fast-paced action [that] make it readable.\"[30] This echoed Nicholas Tucker's praise for the story's suspense in the New Statesman: \"Adams ... has bravely and successfully resurrected the big picaresque adventure story, with moments of such tension that the helplessly involved reader finds himself checking whether things are going to work out all right on the next page before daring to finish the preceding one.\"[35]D. Keith Mano, a science fiction writer and conservative social commentator writing in the National Review, declared that the novel was \"pleasant enough, but it has about the same intellectual firepower as Dumbo.\" He pilloried it further: \"Watership Down is an adventure story, no more than that: rather a swashbuckling crude one to boot. There are virtuous rabbits and bad rabbits: if that's allegory, Bonanza is an allegory.\"[36]John Rowe Townsend notes that the book quickly achieved such a high popularity despite the fact that it \"came out at a high price and in an unattractive jacket from a publisher who had hardly been heard of.\"[37] Fred Inglis, in his book The Promise of Happiness: Value and meaning in children's fiction, praises the author's use of prose to express the strangeness of ordinary human inventions from the rabbits' perspective.[38]Watership Down's universal motifs of liberation and self-determination have been identified with by readers from a diversity of backgrounds; the author Rachel Kadish, reflecting on her own superimposition of the founding of Israel onto Watership Down, has remarked \"Turns out plenty of other people have seen their histories in that book ... some people see it as an allegory for struggles against the Cold War, fascism, extremism ... a protest against materialism, against the corporate state. Watership Down can be Ireland after the famine, Rwanda after the massacres.\" Kadish has praised both the fantasy genre and Watership Down for its \"motifs [that] hit home in every culture ... all passersby are welcome to bring their own subplots and plug into the archetype.\"[39]Awards\n[edit]Adams won the 1972 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject.[40] He also won the annual Guardian Children's Fiction Prize,[41] a similar award that authors may not win twice.[42][c] In 1977 California schoolchildren selected it for the inaugural California Young Reader Medal in the Young Adult category, which annually honours one book from the last four years.[43] In The Big Read, a 2003 survey of the British public, it was voted the forty-second greatest book of all time.[44]Criticism of gender roles\n[edit]The 1993 Puffin Modern Classics edition of the novel contains an afterword by Nicholas Tucker, who wrote that stories such as Watership Down \"now fit rather uneasily into the modern world of consideration of both sexes\". He contrasted Hazel's sensitivity to Fiver with the \"far more mechanical\" attitude of the bucks towards the does portrayed as \"little more than passive baby-factories\".[45]In a 1974 New York Times Book Review essay \"Male Chauvinist Rabbits\", Selma G. Lanes alleges that the does are only \"instruments of reproduction to save his male rabbits' triumph from becoming a hollow victory.\"[46] Lanes argued that this view of female rabbits came from Adams rather than his source text, Ronald Lockley's The Private Life of the Rabbit in which the rabbit world is matriarchal, and new warrens are initiated by dissatisfied young females.[47]In similar vein, literary critic Jane Resh Thomas said Watership Down \"draws upon ... an anti-feminist social tradition which, removed from the usual human context and imposed upon rabbits, is eerie in its clarity\". Thomas also called it a \"splendid story\" in which \"anti-feminist bias ... damages the novel in only a minor way\".[48]Adams's 1996 sequel, Tales from Watership Down includes stories where the female rabbits play a more prominent role in the Watership Down warren.[49]Ownership controversy\n[edit]On 27 May 2020, the high court in London ruled that Martin Rosen, the director of the 1978 film adaptation, had wrongly claimed that he owned all rights to the book, as well as terminating his contract for rights to the film. Rosen had entered into adaptation contracts worth more than $500,000 (£400,000), including licences for an audiobook adaptation and the 2018 television adaptation.In his ruling, Judge Richard Hacon ordered Rosen to pay over $100,000 in damages for copyright infringement, unauthorised licence deals, and denying royalty payments to the Adams estate. Rosen was also directed to provide a record of all licence agreements involving Watership Down, and pay court costs and the Adams estate's legal fees totalling £28,000.[50]Music\n[edit]In the early 1970s Bo Hansson was introduced to the book by his girlfriend. This gave him an idea to create a new album in the same style as his Lord of the Rings album. In 1977 he released the all instrumental El-Ahrairah. The title was taken directly from the pages of Watership Down, with El-Ahrairah being the name of a trickster, folk-hero/deity rabbit, known as The Prince with a Thousand Enemies. In other countries the album was released as Music Inspired by Watership Down.Film\n[edit]Main article: Watership Down (film)In 1978 Martin Rosen wrote and directed an animated film adaptation of Watership Down. The voice cast included John Hurt, Richard Briers, Harry Andrews, Simon Cadell, Nigel Hawthorne, and Roy Kinnear. The film featured the song \"Bright Eyes\", sung by Art Garfunkel. Released as a single, the song became a UK number one hit[51] although Richard Adams said that he hated it.[52]Although the essentials of the plot remained relatively unchanged, the film omitted several side plots. Though the Watership Down warren eventually grew to seventeen rabbits with the additions of Strawberry, Holly, Bluebell, and three hutch rabbits liberated from the farm, the movie includes a band of only eight. Rosen's adaptation was praised for \"cutting through Adams' book ... to get to the beating heart\".[53]The film has also seen some positive critical attention. In 1979 the film received a nomination for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.[54] Additionally, British television station Channel 4's 2006 documentary 100 Greatest Cartoons named it the 86th greatest cartoon of all time.[55] But, \"lovable bunnies notwithstanding, younger children might be troubled by the more graphic scenes. Numerous rabbits die in bloody fights, while one gets choked by a snare and another is snatched by a bird of prey.\"[56]Television\n[edit]Main article: Watership Down (1999 TV series)From 1999 to 2001, the book was also adapted as an animated television series, broadcast on CITV in the UK and on YTV in Canada.[57] Only the first two series were aired in the UK, while all three series were aired in Canada. It was produced by Martin Rosen and starred several well-known British actors, including Stephen Fry, Rik Mayall, Dawn French, John Hurt, and Richard Briers, running for a total of 39 episodes over three seasons. Although the story was broadly based on the novel and most characters and events retained, some of the story lines and characters (especially in later episodes) were entirely new. In 2003, the second season was nominated for a Gemini Award for Best Original Music Score for a Dramatic Series.[58]2018 animated series\n[edit]Main article: Watership Down (2018 TV series)In July 2014, it was announced that the BBC would be airing a new animated series based on the book[59] and in April 2016 that the series would be a co-production between the BBC and Netflix, consisting of four one-hour episodes,[60] with a budget of £20 million. The four-episode serial premiered on the BBC and Netflix on 23 December 2018, with the voices of James McAvoy as Hazel, John Boyega as Bigwig, and Ben Kingsley as General Woundwort.[61] It received generally positive reviews, with praise for the performances of its voice cast, but received criticism for its tone and the quality of the computer animation.[62][63][64]Theatre\n[edit]In 2006, Watership Down was again adapted for the stage, this time by Rona Munro. It ran at the Lyric Hammersmith in London. Directed by Melly Still, the cast included Matthew Burgess, Joseph Traynor, and Richard Simons. The tone of the production was inspired by the tension of war: in an interview with The Guardian, Still commented, \"The closest humans come to feeling like rabbits is under war conditions ... We've tried to capture that anxiety.\"[65] A reviewer at The Times called the play \"an exciting, often brutal tale of survival\" and said that \"even when it's a muddle, it's a glorious one.\"[66]In 2011, Watership Down was adapted for the Lifeline Theatre in Chicago by John Hildreth. This production was directed by Katie McLean Hainsworth and the cast included Scott T. Barsotti, Chris Daley, Paul S. Holmquist, and Mandy Walsh.[67]Role-playing game\n[edit]Main article: Bunnies & BurrowsWatership Down inspired the creation of Bunnies & Burrows, an early role-playing game in which the main characters are talking rabbits, published in 1976 by Fantasy Games Unlimited.[68] It introduced several innovations to role-playing game design, being the first game to allow players to have non-humanoid roles, as well as the first with detailed martial arts and skill systems. Fantasy Games Unlimited published a second edition of the game in 1982, and the game was modified and republished by Steve Jackson Games as an official GURPS supplement in 1992.[citation needed]Radio\n[edit]In 2002, a two-part, two-hour dramatisation of Watership Down by Neville Teller was broadcast by BBC Radio 4.[69][70][71]In November 2016, a new two-part two-hour dramatisation, written by Brian Sibley, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4.[72]Audiobooks\n[edit]In the 1970s, the book was released by Argo Records read by Roy Dotrice, with musical background—music by George Butterworth performed by Academy of St Martin in the Fields under the direction of Neville Marriner.[73][74]Alexander Scourby narrated an unabridged edition, originally published on LP in the 1970s by the Talking Books program of the American Foundation for the Blind (NLSB).[75] The LPs have been destroyed by NLSB and are very rare.In 1984, Watership Down was adapted into a four-cassette audiobook by John Maher in association with the Australian Broadcasting Company's Renaissance Players. Produced by John Hannaford and narrated by Kerry Francis, the audiobook was distributed by The Mind's Eye.[76]In 1990, a 16-hour, 11-cassette recording read by John MacDonald was published by Books on Tape, Inc. of Santa Ana, CA.[77]Andrew Sachs recorded a five and a half-hour abridged version of the story for Puffin Audiobooks.[78]In 2010, Audible.com released an unabridged digital download of the book, narrated by the multiple award-winning Ralph Cosham.[79]In 2019, Blackstone Audio Inc. released an unabridged version of Watership Down with a foreword by the author, Richard Adams. Peter Capaldi narrated the 17-hour, 31-minute book.[80]Graphic novel\n[edit]A new graphic novel version of Watership Down was released in 2023, adapted by award-winning author James Sturm and illustrated by bestselling artist Joe Sutphin.[81]In the American stop motion TV show Robot Chicken, a parody of the book is done with the Fraggles, the main characters of the 80s show Fraggle Rock, in place of the rabbits.[82]The November 1974 issue of National Lampoon magazine, released shortly after the resignation and pardon of President Richard Nixon, featured a satirical parody of the novel entitled \"Watergate Down\", written by Sean Kelly, in which rabbits are replaced by rats, described as animals with \"the morals of a Democrat and the ethics of a Republican\".[83]The Dropout Dungeons & Dragons series Dimension 20 has a side quest \"Burrow's End\" loosely based on Watership Down. The main characters are Stoats looking for a new warren to live in.[84]^ (Random House; Hutchinson and Alfred A. Knopf imprints)\n^ The map in the front of the book indicates the story begins in the real-life Wash Common, just beyond the western tip of the park and parish of Sandleford, on the Berkshire-Hampshire border.\n^ Six books have won both awards in 45 years through 2011; alternatively, six authors have won the Carnegie Medal in Literature for their Guardian Prize-winning books.

{"title":"Charlotte's Web","author":"E. B. White","published":1952,"fiction":true,"plot":"The Arable family are a farm family who raise and sell animals. One day, John Arable attempts to slaughter the runt of a litter of piglets that were born the night before, but his daughter Fern pleads for the piglet's life, and John gives him to her. Naming him Wilbur, Fern treats him as a pet, and the two become incredibly close. Eventually, Wilbur is no longer small, and so John decides to sell him, much to Fern's dismay. Wilbur is given to Fern's maternal uncles, The Zuckermans, allowing her to periodically visit him.From here on, the various farm animals are depicted as talking animals that hide their anthropomorphism from humans. In Zuckerman's barnyard, Wilbur yearns for Fern and is met with varying reactions from the other animals, with some, such as the motherly goose, showing him compassion, and others, such as the head ram, treating him with scorn. Wilbur had a terrible day without getting friends, having an empty stomach and taking medicine. The next morning, he finally gets a friend named Charlotte, a barn spider, whose web sits in a doorway overlooking his pigpen. During the Summer, the ram offhandedly tells Wilbur that Zuckerman is raising him for slaughter and consumption by turning Wilbur into meat, leaving him distraught. As he screams, sobs, panics and mourns his upcoming death, Charlotte comforts him. She promises to find a way to save his life and takes on a motherly role for him. Meanwhile, Fern often listens in on the animals' conversations, to her mother's concern.As summer passes, Charlotte comes up with a plan to save Wilbur. Reasoning that Zuckerman would not kill a famous pig, she weaves words and short phrases in praise of Wilbur into her web, the first phrase being \"Some Pig\". This turns Wilbur, and the barn as a whole, into a tourist attraction because many people believe the web to be a miracle. After the excitement dies down, the phrase gets destroyed. On the goose's suggestion, Charlotte weaves the word \"Terrific\" into her web, beginning the cycle anew. Although Zuckerman is pleased with Wilbur's fame, his plan to slaughter him stays firm. In another effort to maintain the public's interest in him, Charlotte tells Templeton, a gluttonous rat that lives under Wilbur's trough and holds a contentious relationship with the other animals, to get another word for the web. After Templeton gets exhausted of going to the junk and coming back with another word, he finds a laundry detergent ad with the word \"Radiant\", which Charlotte then weaves into her web.As a result of this latest round of fame, Zuckerman enters Wilbur in the county fair, and Charlotte and Templeton accompany him. The Arables also go to the fair. Charlotte weaves the last word brought by Templeton, \"Humble\", into the web she spins at Wilbur's stall at the fair. Wilbur fails to win first prize because Templeton told him and Charlotte that the pig next door has already won it, but is awarded a special prize by the judges. Charlotte, who has laid an egg sac at the fair, hears the presentation of the award over the public address system and realizes that the prize means Zuckerman will cherish Wilbur for as long as he lives and will never slaughter him. However, Charlotte, being a barn spider with a naturally short lifespan, is already dying of natural causes by the time the award is announced. Knowing that she has saved Wilbur, and satisfied with the outcome of her life, she decides not to return to the barn with Wilbur and Templeton. She gives them her final request to have her egg sac taken back to the barn, and then dies alone at the fairgrounds the next day.Wilbur waits until spring and Charlotte's children hatch. Most of them fly away on their balloons, much to Wilbur's dismay thinking he might suffer loneliness again, but three choose to remain. Future descendants of Charlotte keep Wilbur company for many years, though he always holds Charlotte in more esteem than them all. Fern, the girl who used to come to the farm almost every day, has grown, and decides to spend time with friends including Henry instead.Death\n[edit]Death is a major theme seen throughout the book and is brought forth by that of Charlotte. According to Norton D. Kinghorn, Charlotte's web acts as a barrier that separates the two worlds of life and death.[5] Scholar Amy Ratelle says that through Charlotte's continual killing and eating of flies throughout the book, White makes the concept of death normal for Wilbur and the readers.[6] Neither Wilbur nor Templeton sees death as a part of their lives; Templeton sees it only as something that will happen at some time in the distant future, while Wilbur views it as the end of everything.[7]Wilbur constantly has death on his mind at night when he is worrying over whether or not he will be slaughtered.[8] Even though he is able to escape his death, Charlotte, who takes care of him, is not able to escape her own. She passes away, but, according to Trudelle H. Thomas, \"even in the face of death, life continues and ultimate goodness wins out\".[9] Jordan Anne Deveraux explains that E.B. White discusses a few realities of death. From the novel, readers learn that death can be delayed but that no one can avoid it forever.[10]Change\n[edit]For Norton D. Kinghorn, Charlotte's web also acts as a signifier of change. The change Kinghorn refers to is that of both the human world and the farm/barn world. For both of these worlds, change is something that can't be avoided.[5] Along with the changing of the seasons throughout the book, the characters also go through their own changes. Jordan Anne Deveraux also explains that Wilbur and Fern each go through their changes to transition from childhood closer to adulthood throughout the novel.[10] This is evidenced by Wilbur accepting death and Fern giving up her dolls. Wilbur grows throughout the book, allowing him to become the caretaker of Charlotte's children just as she was a caretaker for him, as is explained by scholar Sue Misheff.[11] But rather than accept the changes that are forced upon them, according to Sophie Mills, the characters aim to go beyond the limits of change.[8] In a different way, Wilbur goes through a change when he switches locations. Amy Ratelle explains that when he moves from the Arables' farm to Homer Zuckerman's farm, he goes from being a loved pet to a farm animal.Innocence\n[edit]Fern goes from being a child to being more of an adult. As she experiences this change, Kinghorn notes that it can also be considered a fall from innocence.[5] Wilbur also starts out young and innocent at the beginning of the book. A comparison is drawn between the innocence and youth of Fern and Wilbur. Sophie Mills states that they can identify with one another.[8] Both Wilbur and Fern are, at first, horrified by the realization that life must end; however, by the end of the book, they learn to accept that, eventually, everything must die.[10] According to Matthew Scully, the book presents the difference in the worldview of adults versus the worldview of children. Children, such as Fern, believe killing another for food is wrong, while adults have been gradually conditioned to believe that it is natural.[12]The book was published three years after White began writing it.[13] His editor, Ursula Nordstrom, said that one day in 1952, he arrived at her office and handed her a new manuscript, the only copy of the book then in existence, which she read soon after and enjoyed.[14] The book was released on October 15, 1952.[15][16][17]In light of White's Death of a Pig, published in 1948,[18] which gives an account of his own failure to save a sick pig (bought for butchering), the book can be seen as his attempt \"to save his pig in retrospect\".[19] His overall motivation for the book has not been revealed, and he once wrote: \"I haven't told why I wrote the book, but I haven't told you why I sneeze, either. A book is a sneeze.\"[20]Dear Vladimir:\n\nThere is a large grey spider that commonly inhabits out-buildings and sheds, and I turn to you on the chance that you know her and can enlighten me as to certain of her more intimate habits and functions—this because she figures in a book I am writing and I find myself, at this point, stuck....\n\n—E. B. White, October 8, 1950[21]White encountered the spider at his farm in Hancock County, Maine in October 1950. Unable to identify it himself, he asked his friend Vladimir Nabokov, the novelist and lepidopterist, for advice. Nabokov replied that he knew \"nothing at all\" about spiders, but suggested that White contact Willis J. Gertsch at the American Museum of Natural History.[21] Gertsch's book American Spiders was one of the sources for the arachnid anatomical terms (mentioned in the beginning of chapter nine), along with The Spider Book by John Henry Comstock, both of which combine a sense of poetry with scientific fact.[22] White incorporated details from Comstock's accounts of baby spiders, most notably the \"flight\" of the young spiders on silken parachutes.[22]He sent Gertsch's book to illustrator Garth Williams.[23] Williams's initial drawings depicted a spider with a woman's face, and White suggested that he simply draw a realistic spider instead.[24]White's original name for the novel's spider character was Charlotte Epeira (after Epeira sclopetaria, the Grey Cross spider, now known as Larinioides sclopetarius), before discovering that the more modern name for that genus was Aranea.[25] In the book, Charlotte gives her full name as \"Charlotte A. Cavatica\", revealing her as a barn spider, an orb-weaver with the scientific name Araneus cavaticus.[citation needed]White originally opened the book with an introduction of Wilbur and the barnyard (which later became the third chapter) but decided to begin the book by introducing Fern and her family on the first page.[23] White's publishers were at one point concerned with the end and tried to get him to change it.[26]Charlotte's Web has become White's most famous book, but he treasured his privacy and that of the farmyard and barn that helped inspire it, which have been kept off limits to the public according to his wishes.[27]The book was generally well-reviewed when it was released. In The New York Times, Eudora Welty wrote: \"As a piece of work it is just about perfect, and just about magical in the way it is done.\"[28]Aside from its paperback sales, the book is 78th on the all-time bestselling hardback book list. According to publicity for the 2006 film adaptation (see below), it has sold more than 45 million copies and been translated into 23 languages. It was a Newbery Honor book for 1953, losing to Secret of the Andes by Ann Nolan Clark for the medal.[29][30]In 1970, White won the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal, a major prize in the field of children's literature, for Charlotte's Web along with his first children's book, Stuart Little (1945).[31]Seth Lerer, in his book Children's Literature, finds that Charlotte represents female authorship and creativity, and compares her to other female characters in children's literature such as Jo March in Little Women and Mary Lennox in The Secret Garden.[32]Nancy Larrick brings to attention the \"startling note of realism\" in the opening line, \"Where's Papa going with that ax?\"[33]Illustrator Henry Cole expressed his deep childhood appreciation of the characters and story, and calls Garth Williams's illustrations full of \"sensitivity, warmth, humor, and intelligence\".[34] Illustrator Diana Cain Bluthenthal states that Williams' illustrations inspired and influenced her.[35]An unabridged audio book read by White himself reappeared decades after it had originally been recorded.[36]Newsweek writes that White reads the story \"without artifice and with a mellow charm\", and that \"White also has a plangency that will make you weep, so don't listen (at least, not to the sad parts) while driving\".[36] Joe Berk, president of Pathway Sound, had recorded the book with White in his neighbor's house in Maine (which Berk describes as an especially memorable experience) and released it in LP.[37] From Michael Sims: \"The producer later said that it took him 17 takes to read the death scene of Charlotte. And finally, they would walk outside, and E.B. White would go, this is ridiculous, a grown man crying over the death of an imaginary insect. And then, he would go in and start crying again when he got to that moment.\"[38] Bantam released Charlotte's Web alongside Stuart Little on CD in 1991, digitally remastered, having acquired the two books for rather a large amount.[37]In 2005, a teacher in California conceived of a project for her class in which they would send out hundreds of drawings of spiders (each representing Charlotte's child, Aranea, going out into the world so that she can return and tell Wilbur of what she has seen) with accompanying letters; they ended up visiting a large number of parks, monuments, and museums, and were hosted by and/or prompted responses from celebrities and politicians such as John Travolta and then-First Lady Laura Bush.[39]In 2003, the book was listed at number 170 on the BBC's The Big Read poll of the UK's 200 \"best-loved novels\".[40] A 2004 study found that it was a common read-aloud book for third-graders in schools in San Diego County, California.[41] Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed it as one of its \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children.\"[42] It was one of the \"Top 100 Chapter Books\" of all time in a 2012 poll by School Library Journal.[43]In 2010, the New York Public Library reported that Charlotte's Web was the sixth most borrowed book in its history.[44]Its awards and nominations include:Film\n[edit]The book was adapted into an animated feature of the same name in 1973[48] by Hanna-Barbera Productions and Sagittarius Productions and released by Paramount Pictures with a score by the Sherman Brothers. This film was followed on March 18, 2003 by a direct-to-video sequel, Charlotte's Web 2: Wilbur's Great Adventure, that was released by Paramount Home Entertainment and Universal Home Entertainment Productions, with Nickelodeon Animation Studio providing animation services.A live-action film adaptation of the book, produced by Paramount Pictures, Walden Media, Kerner Entertainment Company, and Nickelodeon Movies, was released on December 15, 2006. It starred Dakota Fanning as Fern and Julia Roberts as the voice of Charlotte.Upcoming television miniseries\n[edit]On March 8, 2022, it was announced that Sesame Workshop was working on an animated miniseries based on the book.[49] It was in production for a few months, and was slated to premiere in 2024 on Cartoon Network and HBO Max.[50] On November 3, 2022, it was reported that the miniseries would not be moving forward.[51] However, Canadian animation studio Guru Studio claimed it is still in production.[52]Stage\n[edit]Main article: Charlotte's Web (musical)A musical production was created with music and lyrics by Charles Strouse.[53]Video game\n[edit]Main article: Charlotte's Web (video game)A video game of the 2006 film was developed by Backbone Entertainment and published by THQ and Sega, and released on December 12, 2006, for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS and PC.[54] A separate game also based on the film was released a year later for the PlayStation 2 developed by Blast!

{"title":"The Ginger Man","author":"J. P. Donleavy","published":1955,"fiction":true,"plot":"The novel follows a wealthy disaffected American student, Sebastian Dangerfield, during his time studying law at Trinity College.[7] The book chronicles Dangerfield's violent and sexual misadventures and troubled relationship with his English wife and daughter.Donleavy's friend and fellow writer Brendan Behan was the first person to read the completed manuscript.[8][9] The book was rejected by numerous publishers, but The Manchester Guardian published some extracts from it, calling the book a \"comic triumph\".[10] Subsequently, Behan told Donleavy about Olympia Press, a Paris-based English-language publisher that had produced works by Samuel Beckett,[10] and Donleavy succeeded in getting the book published by them, but was angered when he discovered that it had done so under its pornography imprint.[11]In his 1994 autobiography The History of The Ginger Man, Donleavy wrote, \"I smashed my fist upon its green cover format, published as it was in the pseudonymous and pornographic Traveller's Companion Series, and I declared aloud, 'If it's the last thing I ever do, I will avenge this book.'\"[10] Donleavy and the owner of Olympia Press, Maurice Girodias, became embroiled in decades of legal cases, The Guardian noting: \"Twenty years later, the two parties were still suing each other, under the guise of phantom companies – Donleavy was 'The Little Someone Corporation' – with no end in sight. Girodias had declared himself bankrupt, and was preparing to buy back the title of his beloved Olympia Press at an auction in Paris. Donleavy learned of the sale and sent his wife to France with a large sum in cash. When bidding went over $8,000, Girodias ran out of money. The mysterious woman (as Girodias saw her) made a final bid, and the Olympia Press belonged to Donleavy.\"[9]Upon its publication, it was initially banned both in Ireland and the United States of America by reason of obscenity.The Ginger Man has sold 45 million copies worldwide and has never been out of print.[12] It was named one of the 100 Best Novels of the 20th Century by the Modern Library in 1998.[3] The book was reprinted in 2001, and republished on 29 July 2010 (2010-07-29) by Grove Press.[13]In 1958, Norman Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary, noted in The New York Times that, \"In recent months a large number of remarkably accomplished first novels by Americans have appeared, all of them bearing the usual exclamations of enthusiasm from the publishers on their dust jackets. What is most surprising, some of them – notably William Humphrey's Home From the Hill and J. P. Donleavy's The Ginger Man – justify the excitement. […] What really makes The Ginger Man a vital work is the fact that it both reflects and comments dramatically on the absurdities of an age clinging to values in which it simply cannot believe and unable to summon up the courage to find out what its moral convictions really are\".[14]Writing in The Guardian in 2004, James Campbell judged that, \"The Ginger Man still reads well today, once one becomes accustomed to its headlong rush of style, its frequent verbless sentences, the switch of tenses and the manic swing between first and third persons as it lunges to catch the protagonist's babbling thoughts […] In other places, the prose hops along alliteratively, with hints of Joyce and Dylan Thomas. Many chapters end with a snatch of verse, a habit that began in Donleavy's first book and became his signature tune\".[9]In the 2010 reissue of The Ginger Man, Jay McInerney noted in the introduction that the book \"has undoubtedly launched thousands of benders, but it has also inspired scores of writers with its vivid and visceral narrative voice and the sheer poetry of its prose\".[11]Donleavy wrote a stage adaptation of The Ginger Man, directed by Philip Wiseman, which opened in London in September 1959, with Richard Harris playing Dangerfield. In October, the play opened in Dublin, also starring Harris, and was closed after three performances, owing to the play's offensiveness (according to the Dublin critics), and following protests from the Catholic Church.[12] All this is recorded by Donleavy in the 1961 Random House publication of the play with an essay by Donleavy, \"What They Did in Dublin with The Ginger Man (a play)\".The BBC produced a 90-minute made-for-television version of the play, directed by Peter Dews, and aired on 23 March 1962 in the United Kingdom. Ann Bell played Marion Dangerfield, Ronald Fraser as Kenneth O'Keefe, Ian Hendry as Sebastian Balfe Dangerfield, and Margaret Tyzack was Miss Frost.[15]Donleavy asked director George Roy Hill to film the novel (the two of them, along with Gainor Crist, had been at Trinity together), but Hill felt that he would lose perspective because the project would be too close to his heart and his time as a young man at Trinity.[16]In 2005 there was reportedly discussion with actor Johnny Depp about starring in a film based on the novel.[17] Rumors of getting the project started surfaced every year or two since 1998, including Depp traveling to Dublin to work on a script with Donleavy, and Depp enlisting Shane MacGowan for a part, but it never seemed to get going. In 2006 it appeared things were taking shape, with Depp selecting a director, Laurence Dunmore (The Libertine).[18][19][20] Apparently, interest waned with the success of Pirates of the Caribbean.[21] Depp returned to Ireland to meet with Donleavy again in the summer of 2008.[22] As recently as June 2009, Donleavy was still hopeful that Depp would start the project in earnest.[23]The book also inspired songs of the same name, the first recorded by Geoff Muldaur, Fritz Richmond, and John Sebastian on the 1964 Elektra The Blues Project (EKL-264). (However, the liner notes for this album indicate that the song was a tribute to Richmond.) A second was written and recorded by Australian singer-songwriter Brian Cadd and was released as the first single from his self-titled debut album, released in October 1972.[24][25]Donleavy, James Patrick:^ \"The Ginger Man: 60th Anniversary Limited Edition\".
